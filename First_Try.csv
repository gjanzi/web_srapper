What an experience. If you're looking for good Texas BBQ, Terry Blacks is the way to go. This was by far the biggest, most savory piece of meat I have ever consumed. The prices may shock you, but trust me, it's worth it. For $28 a pound, I went with the beef rib. Yup just one beef rib. It's so big it acts as a whole cut on its own, and deserves a rack of 12 separate ribs. Wasn't expecting this kind of style of a dining experience, but it suits the restaurant the best. You may face a long line, but it moves fast and without many issues. The ordering process is simple and we were in and out within 8 minutes. Plenty of seating indoors and outdoors even on a packed day, so don't let the crowds fool you.I do wish the sides were a bit cheaper. Don't see why they have to price gauge a pint of mac and cheese and potato salad for $6.50 when any high end BBQ joint will charge you a normal amount of $2.50 for the same serving. You're already paying a lot as it is for the meat, so a side or two isn't going to break the bank anyway. Overall, I really enjoyed the meal here. A delicious slab of meat that'll put you in a food coma for hours. My recommendation is to hop on a bird scooter and enjoy the afterwards. That's what we did and it was the perfect remedy!","Los Angeles, CA",8,140,154,"[40.0, 62.0, 31.0, 5.0, 2.0]",May-19,85,19,46,"['Elite 2021', '’20']"

Hubby and I were driving through Austin on one of our road trips and we knew we had to get some Texas-style bbq. We were able to do an online preorder the previous day, and were lucky enough that they weren't super busy so that we were able to enjoy the bbq fresh on one of their picnic tables outside. Might be easier to do a bullet point for what we ordered and what we thought, so here goes!Meats:Beef ribs - These things are ginormous. You'll end up paying around $40.00 for one rib, but honestly this one rib is a full meal for one or can be shared by up to 3 people and will be enough meat for everyone to appreciate it. It was tender, super juicy, and just so satisfying. Pork ribs - Literally fell off the bone when I bit into it. The dry rub was fantastic. Honestly, you wouldn't need to add any bbq sauce because it's packed with flavor and juicy. Excellent choice. Cheese and jalapeño sausage - This is like a little treat. You can taste the spices used in the sausage, you get small chunks of gooey cheese, and the jalapeños added a nice subtle heat. Chopped brisket - Tasty, but my least favorite of the meat choices we ordered. It felt a little dry, and I wasn't sure if they doused it in their bbq like it was described on their menu. I ended up having to add more sauce. Maybe they used a leaner part of the brisket for this, so might be a good option if you're trying to watch your intake (but honestly if you're going to a bbq pit while on a strict diet, you're missing out - everything in moderation is ok!).Sliced brisket - Wow. The pièce de résistance of the entire meal. Best brisket ever. Tender, juicy, flavorful. The balance of lean meat and fat. I now wish I had ordered 5 pounds of this to take home, or even ordered one of their chilled whole briskets. This is the brisket of dreams. No joke, you have to try it. Sides:Cornbread - Great cornbread. It was moist, it had a nice nutty flavor to it. It's a nice sweet bite in between all the savory of the bbq. Coleslaw - I typically don't like coleslaw, but they do theirs well. Nice, chunky and crispy cabbage. The dressing wasn't too thick or too fatty. It's a nice refreshing bite to balance out all the fatty goodness from the bbq. We ordered a half pound of everything (that's the minimum allowed with their online ordering, not sure if you can order less in person), and one beef rib for two people. Definitely more than we could finish. What we ordered would be good for probably up to four adults and everybody would've been full. I can't wait to return to Austin so I can visit again!","Jacksonville, FL",413,358,652,"[84.0, 157.0, 78.0, 29.0, 10.0]",Sep-09,975,265,616,"['Elite 2021', '’20', '’19', '’18', '’17', '’16', '’15', '’14']"

The line may look long from the outside, but the restaurant staff is extremely efficient so it goes by pretty fast.We ordered the following:2 lbs Beef Ribs1 lb Sliced Brisket1 pint Mac n Cheese1 pint Potato Salad1 pint Creamed Corn1 pint Banana Pudding1 pint Peach CobblerPecan PieComplimentary Pickles, Bread, and OnionsSweet teaUnsweetened tea Our favorite items were the Beef Ribs, Mac n Cheese, and Banana Pudding. I'd highly recommend those. The Beef Ribs were the crowd fav of our group and the main reason we'd all come back. It was extremely tender, smoky, and the meat fell off the bone easily. The Mac n Cheese was super cheesy and delicious. Banana Pudding was really flavorful and light. We liked it more than the Peach Cobbler since we felt that the peach cobbler was missing vanilla ice cream. They ran out of Pork Ribs and cornbread by the time we got to the front of the line which was a bit of a bummer. Come early and before peak dinner time so the popular items don't sell out. For drinks, we ordered two cups of unsweetened and sweet tea. They offered unlimited refills. Both teas were great, but I preferred mixing both to balance the sweetness level.The next time I'm in Austin or Dallas, I'll absolutely be back here. It was a perfect last supper meal to end my weekend trip.

The ribs were extra tender, slid right off the bone and seasoned to perfection. All of it was complemented perfectly by their BBQ sauce.The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because the sides were lacking.

So go on a weeknight if you don't want to wait.It was cafeteria style, and you first pick out your sides. We basically tried everything: green beans, creamed corn, cornbread, potato salad, mac and cheese, and banana pudding. The pecan pie looked good too but that would've been even more over the top. My favorite sides were the creamed corn and potato salad. My boyfriends were the creamed corn and Mac and cheese. I thought the Mac and cheese sauce was a bit gluey, but I think that's because it was American cheese  we also got some sweet tea. The corn bread and green beans were decent though not rave worthy. Just glad I could get some green veggies in.For meat, we tried the beef rib, 1/2 brisket, and jalapeño sausage. I liked the beef and thought the sausage was decent, though it wasn't my fave. Beef was fall off the bone tender, perfectly seasoned IMO, and beautifully smokey. The beef rib was a bit expensive (around $30 I think) and our total for the evening came out to about $80. Probably could've done without the sausage and with just 1/4 lb of brisket (and probably could've finished our food that way too.) bu I would definitely come back in the future and recommend to others on a trip to Austin!It was also cool to talk to the guys working the pits at the side of the restaurant.

Overpriced? Maybe but you're paying for the quality and reputation. This must be quite the tourist destination as well as local spot. We got there only 15 minutes after they opened and there was already a long line out the door. The line did move smoothly though and we ended up waiting around 20 minutes before we got to order. It's cafeteria style ordering so you order all the sides and meats, load them up on your tray, and then pay. As mentioned, the price is higher than what I'm used to in NC where I live. The sides were about 3 bucks a piece for the small sizes we got. We got sides of mac & cheese, green beans, potato salad, sweet corn, banana pudding, and cornbread. A half pound of sliced beef brisket which equates to only 2 slices costs 13 bucks. The piece of pork rib and the cheese jalepeno sausage each cost around 10 bucks. The total for our tray cost a total of 50 bucks. I would say an equivalent of this amount of stuff in NC would probably be around half the price. Oh well, when Texas you gotta try it out.The price may have not been ideal but the taste of the food was absolutely phenomenal. They ain't kidding around. The smokiness in the meats adds so much depth of flavor and can be tasted with each bite. The brisket was nice and fatty - just superb. The pork rib was fall off the bone and the cheese jalepeno sausage - best darn sausage I've ever had. The sides were just as good. Green beans were stir fried with some butter & garlic and rich with flavor. Mac & cheese was creamy. Sweet corn was not from your typical can and cooked with some kind of cream sauce - also the best sweet corn I've tasted. Potato salad had rosemary and other herbs - outstanding. Banana pudding was decadent and cornbread tasted good. All of the food just downright delivered and left us satisfied. They also allow customers to visit their smokehouse to understand the cooking process if interested and to answer any questions you have. We visited after our meal and it was very educational. Apparently, they're constantly cooking/smoking the meats 24 x 7. They have an overnight crew that continues to tend to the meats after the restaurant closes. So a lot of love and dedication goes to the food here. Overall, this place is one of the joints that pop up when you Google for good bbq in Austin and there's a good reason why.

It's gotta be good right???We walked in, it's ""cafeteria-style"" which should have clued us in on what we were about to get. The first section served side dishes, each was served in a 5.5oz. tray. Take your pick they're all $2.95 ea. Then you go to the Meat section and select the meats. The meat server knew his stuff and seemed pretty bored. He turned on his spiel and cut the meat. They cut and weigh each based on what you ask for and how much you want. Want just one slice of brisket? ok, just one or two ribs? OK! A lot of one and none of the other? You got it!Here's what we got for $57.93...1) three slices of beef brisket-2) three pork ribs from the short end3) a serving of cornbread4) two 5.5oz. servings of peach cobbler5) a 5.5oz. serving of baked beans6) a 5.5oz. serving of mac & cheese7) a bottle of water8) a bottle of orange sodaSome background, we're not big eaters, and I don't mind paying for good food but, but this seems pretty spendy for what was on the tray. There were three sauces on the table- ""Original"" meh, it's nothing to write home about.""Spicy""      Spicy? hardly, and I'm not one of those that eat habs as a hobby.""Sweet""    Yes, it was sweet.None of their sauces were earth-shattering nor any better than Kraft's BBQ sauces. Let's review each of the items above:Beef Brisket: The brisket was cooked super tender, the meat by itself had a rub of salt, black pepper, sugar, and probably paprika and other spices which was most likely the same as that on the ribs. One can see the obvious smoke ring circling the brisket. The meat on the outermost areas of the brisket had good flavor and texture and just the right amount of give. As you get deeper towards the center of the brisket the meat becomes blander and the texture changes drastically to almost mushy and so soft you can hardly tell it's meat.Overall, the outside was good and the center was very unappetizing. I ate one whole piece and moved on...Pork Ribs:The rib meat was fall-off-the-bone-tender. It seemed like they use the same rub on the pork as the brisket. The flavor was similar but since it was pork, it had a little different profile. Other than the salty, peppery, sweet flavor there was little else unless you added the BBQ sauces. Cornbread:I've had better at KFC. Peach Cobbler:Seriously? It was more crust than cobbler and there wasn't much ""peach"" flavor or slices in the cobbler. it's a good thing it was only 5.5 oz. At $2.95, which was a couple of bucks more than it should have been.Baked Beans:OK, I know I'm in TX, and they do things their own way here, but these were SALTY! Just salt and beans. There was none of that sweet molasses flavor or the subtle taste of smoke and bits of ham or bacon or pork. I had two bites and was done. Mac & Cheese:Hmmmmmm, how does one make mediocre Mac & Cheese? Well, if you open a can this is what it tasted like. Institutional-style Mac & Cheese. Sorry guys, this was a fail. You didn't even doctor up the can of M&C with your own take on it, nope just open the can and dumped it into the steam tray.---------Overall the entire meal was just meh, not nearly what I expected after all the four and five-star reviews on Yelp. Based on this visit, I wouldn't come back, especially at that price. I get they aren't known for their sides, but at least give us good decent sides at a fair price, not overcharge for canned junk. If you actually DO have a human make that stuff in-house, they must have lost their taste buds. If you're known for your BBQed meats then dammit, give us the goods. The stuff I tasted made Dickey's BBQ seem like gourmet food. Is it because we came at about 3:30 pm, after the lunch rush, and before the dinner rush??? Was it old meat that had been sitting in the warming oven at too high a temp and just kept cooking??? If that's the case, it's pretty bad that they charge that much for second-rate food. Very, very disappointed :-(Save your money, go to a local joint who has people that give a rat's ass.","Sacramento, CA",27,50,18,"[17.0, 9.0, 7.0, 7.0, 10.0]",Nov-10,93,10,15,['never']

I tried all of the 3 bbq sauces (original, sweet, and spicy). I suggest trying all 3 sauces because they are all amazing I was having a tough time deciding which sauce was my favorite.

At the other end is where you fill your drinks/grab to go boxes.The sauces and napkins are at the sit down table. I highly suggest dining in to get the whole experience. I love the interior decors!!

The brisket was super moist and seasoned deliciously. I also liked their traditional sauce! Overall great experience and they had plenty of seating both indoors and outdoors for groups of up to 6-8! Definitely will come back when I'm in Austin to skip some of the long lines I've waited at Franklin's or La Barbecue although both of those places food were great as well.

I have heard a lot about Franklins but didn't have the free time to brave the lines. I've previously tried Coopers, Salt Lick, and Pecan Lodge in Dallas so I feel like I have a good bar to judge Texas bbq on. Salt Lick and Pecan Lodge are still my favorites. Terry Black's was great, but it did not quite live up to my expectations for TX bbq. I had a half pound of brisket and 2 pork ribs (1/3 lb). The ribs were super tender and came right off the bone. The brisket was a little more dry than I was hoping for. I had read other more positive reviews on here so I was thinking maybe my food wasn't as fresh since I came late in the day? I have had better BBQ in Phoenix (Little Miss). If I lived in Austin, I would probably come back here and give it a second chance. If and when I visit Austin again, I will probably try something else or make the drive to Salt Lick. As smoker legend Charles P. Thompson always says ""With great barbecue comes great responsibility"" or something like that.","Chandler, AZ",35,94,119,"[72.0, 20.0, 2.0, 0.0, 0.0]",Jun-19,243,160,164,"['Elite 2021', '’20', '’19']"

The line is long there is even a little window halfway there for you to order water or and adult beverage lol. The prices here are affordable and reasonable. We weren't a fan of the black margarita but the color was cool lol. Ok, the meats, wow! Like we all know turkey is dry but it is flavorful and mouth watering here. Turkey for christ sake lol. The brisket was beyond my favorite here. It was so juicy and packed with flavor. Honestly, it felt like fine dining. The sides we got was the sweet corn, potato salad and Mac and cheese. I must say the potato salad was average but the sweet corn was out of this world. It was perfect. The Mac and cheese was very cheesy and delicious, as if the cheese was just made and pasteurized lol. Took my in laws here from Puerto Rico and they are VERY PICKY when it comes to food. They were amazed with the food here and actually ate the sweet corn. They tend to say some American side dishes are desserts (like sweet potato) but they loved the sweet corn and the other sides. This made me happy. We were a family of ten and paid about $250 for all that we ordered. I don't think it's too bad, costly yes, but for the experience and the overall quality of the meat, you can't go wrong honestly. I was a bit disappointed that the corn bread breaks off to easily so it was as if eating powdered corn bread lmao and I loved the pecan pies, absolutely delicious; it tasted home made. I loved the decor, organization and placement of table. In terms of our current safety measures, not met whatsoever. Face covering not required, absolutely no social distancing nor limited capacity.

The 3 sauces were not bad although we didn't really use them.The beef brisket were HEAVENLY, super duper juicy with its luscious fat that accompanied it. The meat basically came apart.

That's all I have to say if you're wanting to place an order - make sure you get in your order early.Curbside pickup was a breeze. You place your order online, they email you your receipt with a check number and complete pickup instructions. They send you a reminder email the day before your chosen pickup day - wasn't forgetting, trust me, but appreciated nonetheless. Day of, you're directed into the parking lot, to a numbered parking spot, text the number on the sign and interact with their order texting bot, pop open your trunk and wait for your order to come right out. Might've been 10-15 minutes of waiting in the car but in the before times, I know this would be a several hour long wait so I ain't complaining in the least.Pork ribs - stellar. Loved the peppery rub and the smokiness. Pulled pork - a little leaner than I would have liked, I think. But with their sauces, I'm in heaven. Chopped beef - wouldn't miss it for the world. I believe it's mixed with a bit of their espresso barbecue sauce so just a hint of it comes through letting the taste of the beef shine - spectacular. Wish I had the foresight to have ordered two weeks ahead but oh well, I'll just have to hit up Franklin's some other time for their brisket and beef rib.Oh, sides! Potato salad was mustardy, which I liked as it gave a refreshing change of pace with all the meats. Same for the slaw though I personally preferred the potato salad.All in all, great spot, definitely lives up to the hype. Curbside pickup was a breeze and love that they're taking measures to keep customers and employees safe.

Overall, I enjoyed my experience at Franklin's. The brisket (especially the moist) is to die for and is incredibly juicy. Critics argue that it is a little too greasy for their taste, but in my view, that's what you want with brisket. The ribs, sausage links, and BBQ sauce were good too, and I can't complain. As we are in the time of COVID, I felt that it was essential to address the leftover quality. I reheated the leftover bbq using the oven on low. The bbq held the flavor and juiciness extremely well.

I have always wanted to come here and flew in on a work trip and stopped by. Unfortunately, we are still under COVID lockdowns and I was not able to experience the full version of Franklin BUT, what I did taste was the best BBQ I have ever had!I have been a fan of Aaron Franklin for many years. I have his BBQ book and do BBQ in my back yard, but experiencing what he was able to do with the brisket was remarkable. I had to call in an order and you only could order a minimum of 3 lbs per order. Luckily, I trusted Aaron with that requirement and placed the order. Within 10-15 min we had our brisket and it was still wrapped in the butchers paper. The smell was adding weight to me it was that good. When I was finally able to taste it, I realized that no other place that I had ever been to, nor was there any BBQ that I had ever made that was like that. It was the most juicy, fall apart brisket I have ever had. The sauces were also incredible along with the seasoning on the brisket. I had finally found what the ultimate BBQ tastes like. The sad part is that everywhere else I go will be compared to this short abbreviated experience and it's not fair to the other places I have gone and will go, but hey, that is what makes Franklin that much more special. I do promise to come back when we can dine in and get more of what they have to offer and get a full experience.

Think, we shared brisket, pulled pork, and a chopped beef sandwich.They were totally outta side dishes (in the middle of the day) so it was an all meats affair aside from the few carbs derived from the pedestrian white bread served alongside. I later learned this is a customary ""condiment"" at most Texas BBQ places.Not complaining at all, really delicious... just would've preferred that it wasn't so hot and humid that week.","Marina del Rey, CA",11,37,2,"[19.0, 14.0, 3.0, 1.0, 0.0]",Mar-10,35,16,14,['Elite 2021']

It's been my go-to joint for BBQ anytime I am in Austin. I have gone straight to this east-side smoked meat mecca from the airport after landing- suitcases and all!Upon this most recent visit I spotted someone waiting for his order with his luggage in-tow. I can relate to his eagerness.I was pleased to see an online order option. In the past there would be lines out the door and the idea of having my order ready ahead of time was much preferred. When I arrived, my order was freshly prepared and packaged.The brisket is probably the best Texas BBQ I've ever had. I will disclaim that I haven't had Franklins yet since I am not a fan of waiting in lines.The cut is moist like a fatty cut of brisket should be. What puts this brisket above others however is how well it's spiced as well as smoked. I've had my share of bland brisket, but there's nothing bland about la Barbecue.The pork ribs fall right off the bone, which I enjoyed since I'm more of a fork and knife eater. I was pleasantly surprised that there was a little heat in the seasoning of the ribs. The jalapeño sausage is big and beefy with a nice snap. Upon my first bite you can see the little bits of pepper inside. On the side I got some shells and cheese, while the consistency was nice and creamy- it wasn't anything to write home about. The sauces appear to be vinegar based, not my preferred choice but it was a suitable sidekick as I dunked my bites of meat with them.With so many great food options in Austin, it's possible to enjoy something great and different every visit.

Quick piece of advice, order the brisket early, because they occasionally run out and be sure to order ahead on their website; as that's the only option for ordering at the moment. Ordered the brisket, pulled pork, and the chipotle and jalapeno sausages. For our sides we got the kimchi and mac and cheese. Let me start off by saying that this mac and cheese is hands down the best mac and cheese you'll find at any BBQ joint in Austin because it has a flavor in it besides cheese. la barbeque dared to be great by adding some latin influence to their mac with some chipotle seasoning and jalapenos and thank goodness they did so, because the kraft mac n cheese they serve at other places was getting old. The kimchi was disappointing because there wasn't any cabbage. It was pickled cucumbers with a variety of chili and bell peppers. Although, the pickling solution they use is packed with flavor and adds a necessary acidity/freshness to any bite of greasy BBQ.The pulled pork was my least favorite since it came out a little dry and under seasoned. But the sausages and brisket were close to perfection. The brisket comes with a heavy pepper crust and it's so tender, it practically falls apart in your hands. The sausages had a snap to them, were packed with a savory, slightly sweet and spicy filling, and were some of the best sausages you can get in Austin. Overall, la barbeque does more than enough to distinguish itself from the plethora of options in Austin. And is somewhere I look forward to going back.","Addison, Dallas, TX",199,334,1181,"[212.0, 70.0, 41.0, 8.0, 3.0]",Jul-15,571,66,347,"['Elite 2021', '’20', '’19', '’18', '’17']"

Overall the food at la bbq was good but I just can't stress enough how salty everything was and it nearly ruined how beautifully cooked the meat was.  We ordered brisket, pork ribs, house made sausage, potato salad and coleslaw. First the brisket had a perfect ring around the meat and it literally started falling apart as I grabbed it with my fork. It was juicy and tender and everything I had hoped for except it was way too peppery and salty for my taste. Pork ribs were just as tender and falling off the bones but yet again just too much salt and pepper, I had to peel off the bark around it.  With the meats being on the salty side, naturally I was craving sides that were on the sweeter side to balance but both potato salad and coleslaw were also salty and peppery it was just too overwhelming.  Portions were definitely huge and the quality is well worth the price.

We tried the brisket, Turkey, ribs, jalapeño and chipotle sausages, chipotle coleslaw, and the mac and cheese.The brisket was good. Not the best I've ever had, but very delicious. It has a very peppery crust, which I'm into. I saw a lot of the negative reviews complain about the amount of black pepper in some of their food, but that was no problem for me. The turkey was perfectly moist, and I loved the peppery crust (of course). My only wish is that the turkey and brisket were sliced a little thinner, but it's not a huge deal. I did not try the ribs, but I'm told that they were good, just a bit heavy on the sauce. The sausages were both good, but they are a looser sausage than average, if that's something you don't enjoy. I liked the flavor of the chipotle sausage a little better than the jalapeño. They gave us two sauces, and I kind of preferred the mustard based sauce, as the other one had a heavier cumin flavor. As for the sides, the coleslaw was a tad bland (might have just needed some salt), but I really enjoyed their version of mac and cheese.

I miss you! I miss everything about playing in our fair city. This is my first write-up in the throws of the pandemic... so kicking this off on a happy note! It was my mom's 89th birthday and the one thing she was craving above all else was a bit of fabulous moist brisket with some sweet bark. Can do, mama.First things first. Consider not just showing up. Place your takeout order ahead of time. It's easy. la Barbacue is a stand-out at this time because:-  Franklin's BBQ has revised its pandemic takeout minimum from 6 lbs to 3 lbs, but good luck placing that order. I tried and tried and they were booked solid. la Barbacue sets only a one lb minimum. - You can place takeout orders for their righteous, in-the-top-three-bbq- places RIGHT NOW or schedule them for later today or any number of days ahead at a specific hour. - There's a parking lot on the premises and even though it was relatively full on a Sunday afternoon, I had no trouble finding a spot. - Walk around to the west side of the building to ask for your already-placed order. There was no line when I showed up. - The food was ready. It was hot. It was carefully packed. - If you'd like to do curbside, they'll pop your order in the trunk, though I'm not sure what the procedure is for that. Call them from the parking lot?You cannot get specific about what kind of brisket you want (aka lean vs moist, etc) with a takeout order, but no worry. Without any guidance from me, the cuts had just the right balance of fat and lean. My one tiny, itsy bitsy issue is that I had to reach over the counter on the west side of the building and accept the food handover directly from the server, mano a mano. I would have vastly preferred it if he had placed it on the counter and stepped back. I managed to get around this by bringing a grocery bag and having him put it in there, but physical proximity was still too high. I'm SURE he would have been happy to do a curbside so this is also my bad.   All this yammering and I'm finally getting to the quality of the food? My, how our priorities have changed. The brisket was instant happiness-inducing. And the #1 reason I keep going back to la Barbecue is the seasoning. It's so spot on that you don't need a drop of BBQ sauce.The ribs were a wee bit stringy but I'm hard to please so let that pass.

SUPERB. Let me break it down for you travelers. Traveled here for our 15 year anniversary and made a deal that we would not be cooking at all, lol. We had every intention to go to Franklin's as everyone raves about their bbq and we love good bbq. Well after not being able to try Franklin's I did some extensive research and found out that La Barbecue gives Franklins a run for their money so some say. COVID & CLEANLINESSThe hubby and I are more than pleased and even had the leftovers for breakfast the next day. Let me break it down for you. We ordered curbside although the restaurant does provide outside eating and requires masks for COVID. The inside of the establishment is clean and so are the restrooms. They have a retail grocer side as well. Very cute inside and staff is nice. Meat is not cut until you arrive to pick up your order. We arrived an hour after we selected to arrive online but it didn't matter bc EVERYTHING WAS FRESH! Kuddos!FOOD BREAKDOWNThis was more than enough food for two. We ordered 1 lb of brisket, 1/2 lb pork ribs, 1 regular sausage link, 1 jalapeño sausage link, side of smoked Mac & cheese, side of beans, side of potato salad, 2 different sauces. Ask for bread, pickles and onions if you want some. We also requested more crust on our brisket as I saw some recommended to in their reviews bc it's just that good! Yum!RIBS - Hubby and I try not to eat too much pork so we knew our pork treat had to be great and boy was it! The meat fell right off the bone and melted in our mouths. Hopefully I can post the video of hubby's reaction to tasting them. I even tried a bite or two cold hours later bc I'm weird like that and it was still on point. Super tender and juicy even after reheating the next day. Not too salty either.Sausage (Jalapeño & Regular) - BEST sausage I've ever had hands down. Very good quality meat blend which is why it cost almost $6/ link. It's worth it. I loved them both but the jalapeño link was my favorite as it had the right amount of kick from the spice. Not too salty. Smoked just right!Brisket (Extra crust) - Hands down best brisket I've had. Sorry hubby... they've got you beat on the brisket. Flavorful all the way through and not too salty. Fat to meat ratio was spot on. Great quality meat and the crust just helped to seal the deal even more. Cooked to perfection. You definitely do not need sauce for any of their meat bc they obviously know what they're doing when they smoke meat for sure!Smoked Mac & Cheese - BEST I've ever had. I make a mean baked Mac and cheese but their smoked Mac is on another level. Great quality ingredients put together perfectly. Heated up well the next day. A must have!Beans - Ok I make a mean baked beans dish at home but they've got meat beat and hubby agrees. Seasoned well and not too salty. The meat was spot on in ratio to the beans. Heated up well the next day. A must try!Potato Salad - I usually don't try other peoples potato salad bc few get it right. It was good. Consistent flavor and not too bold or bland. Would I order next time...not likely bc the beans and Mac were so good. But, let me be clear that it was not bad. It tasted good; I'm just very particular about my potato salad and wanted to at least try it. You should try it too. Overall I will definitely go back and now I can't wait to also try Franklin's bc so far La Barbecue is my Austin fave! They're likely both very good in their own way! La Barbecue is a must try as they're very consistent with everything in quality and taste!

The wait wasn't too too long, maybe 40 mins or so, though, I mean, there was just one person at register taking orders...so perhaps there's some room for added efficiency? That said, the staff is super friendly and helpful. As for the food - after ogling the menu for the duration of my wait, I was pretty dead-set on the El Sancho Loco sandwich, but clearly couldn't go with sampling some of their unadulterated meats. I opted for a pork rib and a slice of brisket, along with a side of their chipotle slaw.

This has to be one of the best BBQ I've ever had here in Austin. The customer service, food, and ease of ordering is what makes this place amazing for me! Let me walk you thru the reasons why this is a phenomenal BBQ joint:1. Great Customer Service: When you walk in, you are instantly greeted by the bartender asking if you'd like a drink while waiting in line. The bar is literally on your left side as you enter the restaurant. The staff taking your meat order at the pit walks you thru the meat selections and gives good recommendations on how much to order and what meats to try. You are pretty much welcomed to BBQ with a smile and weren't service. 2. BBQ: The BBQ here is amazing, full of flavor, delicious, not dry, and every bite you can taste the smokiness and savory flavors. What makes this place different from. Any other BBQ place I've tried is they douse the meat in their homemade sauce (of course they ask you first, but you are also able to get it on the side). It's like a vinegary, broth-like sauce that adds more flavor to the meats.3. Ease of Ordering: I always get stressed out trying to figure out what I want for sides and meats to get. I like this place because everything is laid out behind a clear glass that you can just point to. The lines starts at the meat selection, condiments, then sides. They have a variety of side to choose from. At the end of the sides, you pay and then there is another station that you can get your pickles/onions, beans, and bread. They've got this figured out and it shows.My overall experience here is def a 10/10. Great tasting food, plus amazing customer services makes for a great time!

It's what you think an old pit barbecue place should feel like. I was here for lunch and had to work so the bar and drinks are not going to be part of the review.  Staff was great. Super friendly and ready to help you get your order in. These guys look like they are setup for volume. Ready to serve a lot of hungry meat eaters. The BBQ Sauce is vinegar based. It's not a sweet barbecue sauce so if that's a deal breaker for you, you should probably move on. Order your meat by the pond. They carve off what you want and while you grab your sides they slice and weigh and package for you. Pork ribs were good and the brisket was tasty. I liked the vinegar barbecue sauce but it's not my favorite. That's totally preference so don't read that as a knock on the place. Had extra sauce, pinto beans, onions, pickles out to grab. I might not search this place out again as I want to try other places when I am in town but I would not be mad if someone brought me here.

I asked for my brisket on the leaner side, but what I ended up with was a bit of a mess of fat and gristle and a crust that didn't compete with the likes of say, Terry Black's.

Parking downtown anywhere can be tricky so we parked in the garage, walked through the hotel and made our way. Nearing the building, we noticed a sign that advertised happy hour from 3p-6p and labeled themselves ""Best Brisket In Town"". Upon entrance you immediately smell the yumminess and bar to your L. The place was pretty packed but the lined moved fairly quick. As we ordered we watched the butcher cut and prepare our trays. My favorite was watching him dip our ribs in a jumbo pot full of BBQ sauce letting the flavors soak then watching the extra drippings before placing it on one tray. Whew! Alongside our ribs we also ordered brisket, sausage and sides of green beans, a baked potato and mac n cheese. The portions were generous and enough to share between the two of us. After getting your food, you pay then head to the condiment station to get your unlimited supply of pickles, onions, BBQ sauce, beans and bread. We opted to sit at the bar and indulge in the happy hour specials. I took a stab at their long island mixed with their sweet tea.

For you PP (pulled pork) enthusiasts, there were a few burnt pieces which were still tasty, but for an $18 dollar plate, it was really light on the pulled pork. I think I got the last of a batch. Look at the picture and judge for yourself. The sides were good, but the meat was the real show stopper. Oh... I had some of my gf's turkey and it was moist, tender and just awesome, especially with the BBQ sauce. If you can take the BBQ sauce home, do it.The space is amazing and the picnic area is beautiful.

If you love meat, meat barbecued to perfection that is, you have to come visit this place. This is what I envisioned bbq in Texas to be. I'm in love with this place. We ordered the AYCE and got to choose 3 proteins, we got beef brisket, sausage, and ribs. I was kinda bummed they didn't have hot links but the perfectly cooked ribs and brisket made me forget all about them. I had a piece of the bread and it was tasty; nice and warm but I didn't want to fill up on this. I had a plan in mind and it was to have all the bbq meat I could handle. After watching a group of 10 people roll in one of those massive coolers with beer inside it, I realized being a first timer I was unprepared for this event and these people were obviously not new to this. This is a bring your own beer type of place and I waaaassssn'ttttt readyyyy!! Anyway, not to worry, right next to the restaurant and I mean right next to it like in the backyard, there's a little place that sells beer. The beer is pretty pricey, it's like 6.50 for I Shiner of 3 for 15; it doesn't matter!! I happily paid for my beer!! Next time I will be bringing my big ass iced cooler with Stella Artois though. Anyway back to my story.... the coleslaw goes the best with all this meat goodness, if you go, get yourself a few sides of slaw and a couple of those sides of fresh crunchy pickles; it's all part of your AYCE. One of the best parts of ordering AYCE, If you don't finish your food, you can pack it up and take it home! Ok, I lied, the best part of this experience is the berry cobbler, omg!! I had 2 of them all warm and gooey with vanilla ice cream and I'd totally do that again!!  I had the most amazing waitress.

So I jumped the gun and went out of my comfort zone for this one and I'm so glad I did. I ordered a Ranch Water to start, it was typical and strong but perfect to compliment my entree. For my meal I ordered the Ribs and Turkey. We also ordered the Beef Ribs and Mac & Cheese to share. The Turkey was the best Turkey I have ever had, moist and well flavored it was amazing. The ribs were very good and tender whew! Of course I added the spicy barbecue sauce and OMG a party in my mouth. You can ask for bread, onions, and pickles. I loved the flavor of the Turkey and onions with the spicy barbecue sauce. Very goood. Nowwww I saw a couple next to us mixing the Mac & Cheese and the baked beans.... so we had to try it. Let me tell you it was amazing... almost like Chilli Mac. Literally the perfect side.

Why doesn't it get to that point? I think it's a personal choice, but my experience in the food was this:I ordered half pound brisket, St. Louis ribs, jalapeño sausage, and mac n cheese. For me, the brisket wasn't fatty enough. The St. Louis ribs were okay. And to be honest, it's okay. It's not bad in no means! But it's alright. I was expecting the person who cut the brisket ask if I wanted fatty or not. And if he did by all means I would have gotten fatty. To me, the cut I got was a bit too lean. Brisket in my mind should be eaten fatty. That fat and juices should just roll off of it. But you must be thinking: ""Why didn't he just proactively ask?"" And my response is, well, you see... I'm no Texan. What I get is what I assume what I'm supposed to get. If there's no choice, then it is what it is.The brisket wasn't overly salty (which I very much enjoyed) but at the same time was dry. And brisket isn't supposed to be dry. Anyways, the pork ribs were on the sweeter side, but I'm willing to overlook that. I was supposed to have gotten the beer rib, but I didn't see it until it was too late! One thing I do have to point out though, the mustard sauce is on point! That in itself is what makes me a fan and a place that makes me want to come back. Overall, Stiles is solid. It didn't meet my overhyped expectations, but if you're tight on the time and don't want to wait 40+ minutes this place is a great pick. You get a taste of Austin BBQ and not a long waiting line.","Norcross, GA",536,1058,2138,"[286.0, 403.0, 279.0, 71.0, 19.0]",Jul-11,1882,504,827,"['Elite 2021', '’20', '’19', '’18', '’17', '’16', '’15', '’14', '’13', '’12']"

Had no wait, but around 330 isn't really a busy time at too many places. For my first time I thought one of the meat platters was a good way to try a few different items. Went for my go to of brisket and asked the person serving me to recommend a second meat and he told me to (surprisingly) to with the turkey breast. For my two sides I went with the pinto beans and corn casserole. The brisket was tasty, had a nice mix of fatty and tender pieces. The flavor on its own was solid but I did find myself dipping it in bbq sauce on most bites. The turkey breast was the most disappointing part of the meal. It came out pretty dry and even the seasoned parts were pretty unflavorful. I mostly used the turkey breast as a vessel to try their various sauces. I personally liked their spicy mustard the best. As for the sides, the corn casserole was the star of the meal. It tasted like you soaked a corn muffin in a glass of milk. Went great with the bbq sauce (I acknowledge how weird this mix is), but I can't recommend it enough. The beans were solid, the menu said they came mixed with brisket but there wasn't much to be found. While the food was a mixed bag, I think I'll be coming back here most for their patio and drink specials to catch a game or hang out if I'm not feeling like going downtown. They have a solid space with a couple tvs and a great deal with any 6 beers for 18$ and they have a pretty solid selection of local craft beers. Overall, the food was a mixed bag but worth trying if you're in the area. I think if you live near this part of town it has super high utility as a close by bbq spot and place to grab a drink.","Cottage Grove, MN",110,358,2383,"[157.0, 140.0, 39.0, 18.0, 4.0]",Feb-12,1600,820,1293,"['Elite 2021', '’20', '’19', '’18', '’17', '’16', '’15']"

I ordered brisket and ribs with the bun on the side. I ordered a drink, but didn't know they only had off brand fountain drinks, which I don't like because of the taste. I noticed after the fact, they sold Coca-Cola and Fanta Orange in glass bottles. I didn't want to stand back in line to try and exchange my drink out so I drunk the off brand drink, lol. Customer service was good. They offer three specialty bbq sauces. I chose the original and I didn't like it because it was too tangy and sweet.

A quart of jalapeño cheese grits brought a little heat and a lot of richness. Then smaller sides of lemon poppy slaw and beet salad brought a little acidity and tang to all that smoky meat. Along for the ride came sauce, pickles, onions, and thick white bread. All the food is so good. The brisket is amazing. And I cannot replicate the lemon poppy slaw, though I try.Due to the abundance of breweries in this town, MCM offers free beers with your order.

This person does not know me, and I wished I were wearing a jacket so I could stuff a can of beer into all six of the pockets and taken a free 8-pack home.

I chose Micklethwait because it was highly recommended and of the places I had bookmarked on Yelp it was one of the closest to the airport. The problem was by the time we got to Micklethwait it was close to 2pm and there weren't a lot of options left. They were out of all the meat except brisket and ribs.  They were out of most of the sides too. This was extremely disappointing, but we were hungry, and there, and there was not wait.  I ordered the brisket plate with jalapeno cheese grits, and chips.  They were out of mac n cheese.  My husband ordered ribs, and brisket with the grits and chips too.  My husband got the last of the ribs so after that there was nothing left but brisket.  I was really disappointed in my brisket.  I thought it was bland.  It needed salt, pepper, seasoning of any kind.  The sauce was good and saved it. Good BBQ shouldn't need sauce and in Texas I am surprised this brisket makes the cut.   The cheese grits were awesome and the kiddo went crazy for them.  I should've got an extra side of those.  My husband said the ribs were good, but nothing special. The location is a food truck with picnic tables so not ideal on a cold or rainy day.  It was late so my kid was safe to run around a bit, but on a more crowded day it could be dangerous with cars/crowds.  Also, no high chairs.  I saw lots of posts about free beer, but we didn't see that.  Maybe they ran out of it too? We ate at Terry Black's 3 days later and found their BBQ to be superior in our opinion.  La Barbecue is my favorite Austin BBQ so far.  I'm never in town early enough/long enough to get Franklin, but it will happen one day...So overall I was disappointed here, but in their defense we were late and had limited choices though I feel like in Texas brisket should always be the star.","Davenport, FL",424,585,5089,"[163.0, 223.0, 126.0, 51.0, 22.0]",Nov-11,2066,638,1181,"['Elite 2021', '’20', '’19', '’18', '’17', '’16', '’15', '’14']"

We saw that popular video and had it staked out as one of the bbq places we wanted to try in Austin. Maybe if we hadn't just gone to Salt Lick the day before this place would have seemed better.We came at about 12pm on a weekday and there was no line and plenty of seats available. No AC when it was 100 kinda sucked.We ended up sharing 1/2 lb brisket, 1/2 lb czech sausage, a side of lemon poppyseed coleslaw and jalapeño cheese grits.Brisket - Probably the most disappointing. It was incredibly fatty to the point that we had to cut chunks of fat off that we couldn't eat. It did have a smokey flavor, but not as amazing as at other places. The amount of meat that was left after all of the fat was gone was really sad.Sausage - This was terrible. It seemed like the sausage you would end up with if you attempted to make it at home for the first time. The skin was so tough that it was impossible to cut through. The meat was in large crumbles that would just come out in clumps as soon as the skin was no longer holding it together. The meat was very dry and bland.Lemon Poppyseed Coleslaw - It was okay. It just tasted like a less creamy coleslaw. I didn't get the ""lemon poppyseed"" flavor that I was expecting.Jalapeño Cheese Grits - We love jalapeño and cheese but had never tried grits before. Wow is this really what grits are like?? I can't even imagine how anyone would like this. It was like eating mush with the flavor of jalapeño and fake cheese. Just no texture at all. We actually found it so disgusting we couldn't even have more than a few spoonfuls.","Fremont, CA",44,278,483,"[83.0, 61.0, 75.0, 31.0, 28.0]",Aug-14,670,288,310,"['Elite 2021', '’20', '’19', '’18', '’17', '’16']"

We walked right up and placed our order and went back to our condo to eat. The brisket was excellent! Extremely tender with a nice smoky flavor. We loved that we could also get a beef rib and not have to come back on a Saturday or special day. The beef rib by the way was fabulous. Very smoky similar to the rib we had at the Salt Lick but much more meaty and velvety tender. We had read about their grits and they were everything we had read about and more.

Seeing as how this was our last full day in Austin, we decided not to wait 3 hours at Franklin's for just brisket and took a short walk to Micklethwait. A few patrons were already seated, waiting for opening time and as 11AM approached, we all got up to get in line. The two of us decided to share a 2 meat plate of brisket and pork spare ribs (sides of jalapeno cheese grits and lemon poppy seed coleslaw) and a half pound of chicken. You get some pickles, red onions, and two slices of bread with your order (they forgot our bread but we went back to the pick-up window to ask for some and there was no hesitation). The amount of food was a little too much, given that we had come from eating our hotel's continental breakfast.The 2 meat plate came with one big slice of brisket and two pork spare ribs. The spare ribs had a delicious peppery rub and was just slightly fatty. The brisket was super tender and fall-apart without being overly fatty. The bbq sauce on their picnic tables complemented the meats well but you also don't really need it. The jalapeno cheese grits were delicious, more on the moist side, and only slightly spicy. The lemon poppy seed coleslaw was super refreshing with the light tangy seasoning.The half pound of chicken came with one drumstick, half a breast, and a thigh + wing. The chicken was moist but not that flavorful. The skin was also quite hard to chew through. I would not recommend it.It was a pretty windy day but their canopies held up and it was nice to have shaded outdoor seating.","San Jose, CA",142,293,568,"[69.0, 152.0, 58.0, 8.0, 6.0]",Dec-13,241,81,117,"['Elite 2021', '’20', '’19', '’18', '’17']"

While down the street, customers were waiting for hours to get the last of Franklin's famous bbq, my friend and I dropped in last minute at micklethwait just before closing to get a late lunch right away.I have to rave about the service here. For starters: FREE BEER. Yup, in addition to the free water at the front of the truck, they also have a cooler filled with free beer for customers to enjoy their meals with. In addition, because my friend and I arrived just before closing, we were able to receive EVERY SIDE for FREE. The food truck wasn't going to be open for a few days so they were super generous in giving us extras of everything (including meat??). We ended up paying around $25 for our meal, and came back with leftovers for days. Excellent service aside, the bbq here is great. We got a generous portion of a pound of brisket, which cut like butter. For the price, we got 3 huge slices, 1 good enough for 1 person. Although not the fattiest cut I've had, it definitely is plenty tender. I especially enjoyed it with their house bbq sauce and fresh red onions. Their sides are also awesome and unique, and lucky for us we got to try them all. My favorite was the potato salad; it was creamy, fresh, and classic, with that lovely addition of dill. I also enjoyed the cheesy grits  and the chili beans, which came with chunks of pulled pork in the spiced sauce (YUM). The poppyseed coleslaw was unique but my least favorite of the sides, being that I found it slightly reminiscent of a poppyseed dessert that i thought didn't pair well.The bbq is treating me well here in Austin so far.","North Druid Hills, GA",302,173,339,"[53.0, 92.0, 27.0, 1.0, 0.0]",Oct-17,120,21,57,"['Elite 2021', '’20', '’19', '’18']"

There's a cooler of free beer. To go along with your beer there's delicious barbecue. I tried the brisket, pork rib, and pulled lamb. All three were great. Not sure it was the ""greatest brisket ever,"" but perfectly tender with a well balanced rub. I'd eat it again and again. Pork rib smoked to perfection (tender but not falling completely apart). The lamb was a surprise menu item (I don't think I've seen it other places), but I loved it. It's meatier than pulled pork but also less fatty and doesn't need to be sauced to be enjoyed. I loved the cheesy grits. They're very good but if you're a major grits connoisseur, don't get your hopes too high (grits are better fresh, not served out of a hot tray). Potato salad was average, and a little dry for my taste - I should have gotten cole slaw instead.Sides can run out early, along with beef ribs and smoked chicken.

My objective? Hit as many BBQ spots over the course of three days as I possibly can (it turned out to be five of them) and see how they stack up. First up was Lamberts, and while this wasn't the rustic pit-centered setup that you might expect when you hear Texas barbecue, the goods delivered nonetheless. Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?Lambert's is actually a pretty swanky sit down spot following what I hear is a recent remodel, and they tether a comfortable environment with fantastic service that's lightning quick. Star. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?Sitting down comes at a bit of a cost that's incremental even to the existing premium placed on Austin BBQ, and the result was $21.00 for what must have been about a half pound of brisket with some peppers and onions, two slices of bread, and a selection of housemade barbecue sauces. That's expensive, but not as much if you're expecting sit down prices and execution. Star. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?I was told by Brian, my genuinely out of this world server, that Lambert's brisket can stand by itself, and I found that... almost to be true. Good flavor? Yes. Great consistency that balanced fat with lean? Yes, but the one place lacking here was the crust, which was thin and without much of a punch. Single Star. Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?Strictly for their brisket and nothing more maybe not, but Lambert's is very much serving a need in providing good barbecue in a sit down environment where you're not going to walk out of there smelling like smoke and meats.

Ordered brisket, pulled pork, chicken fried oysters app, brussels and mac and cheese. Brisket was tasty and that nice melt in your mouth type of fat. Pulled pork was good but not as juicy as I would have liked. Fried oysters on texas toast was a nice treat - fried perfectly. Mac and cheese is very cheesy. Overall pretty solid dishes - BBQ sauce was great too! You also get complimentary corn bread to start and pickled items as a little side dish with your bbq.Atmosphere/service: Came here earlier on a Friday night and was quoted a 30 min wait but got in after 10 (they can put you on the waiting list and text you which is great).

Although the bar was crowded, staff let us stand around the bar area and order off the happy hour menu.  The happy hour menu is a great deal, offering half off all bar food items and two dollars of their signature cocktails.  The bar food menu included items beyond appetizers like barbecue plates.  It was a casual menu, but elevated.  I ordered the Frito Pie and a Prickly Pear Mule, which were both solid.  The Prickly Pear Mule was really nice, as it had a lot of the ginger flavor and was not at all sweet, which is how I like my cocktails.  The Frito Pie was very good, with brisket and goat cheese, a more sophisticated take on the traditional Frito Pie.  I would order it again.  But there is a lot to choose from here.

The coriander and maple-crusted Berkshire pork ribs, though, were tough and dry, a huge disappointment, especially for someone like Matt, who goes to barbecue joints for the ribs.The sides were solid. I liked the new potato salad, the chilled sweet corn salad, and the heirloom carrots and avocado. I also loved the habanero honey pineapple, sweet and tart with a heat that really lingered.For dessert, we ordered the berries and yogurt and a housemade cinnamon roll off the kitchen menu. The berries and yogurt were good, though it didn't come with pecan granola as advertised. The cinnamon roll was sweet and sticky and satisfying, finished with a gooey cream cheese glaze.I enjoyed this visit to Lamberts, but not so much that I'd go back again on another trip to Austin. The food was good, just not quite as good as I remembered.","Austin, TX",1,58,0,"[15.0, 23.0, 11.0, 6.0, 3.0]",Jul-15,14,4,2,['never']

one of the exposed pipes rained on us at the end of our meal.  We were lucky that we were done eating at that point.  Management came over to apologize (and assure us it was not toilet water), and we got our desserts comped.  The water was unpleasant, but they did handle the situation admirably well.  Anyway, that little mishap was not the defining moment of the meal.  Everything else was truly excellent.I drank red wine and a cocktail with my dinner, and both were very good.  I loved the Killer Bee's Knees, a drink with mezcal, tequila, honey syrup, and fresh lemon.  It was smooth and smokey with a little bite and a little sugar, just the kind of cocktail I like to sip on, with or without food.We ate everything family style, and this was both easy to do and highly enjoyable.  We kicked off our meal with a plate of jalapeño cornbread muffins with butter.  They were delicious, lightly hot and sweet and loaded with butter.  We ordered spicy deviled eggs and crispy wild boar ribs as appetizers, and these were great starters.  The deviled eggs gave creaminess and a supple chew, with smoked paprika and a salty burst of American caviar on top.  The middle of the plate held a medley of olives, cornichons, caperberries, jalapeño, and pickled pearl onions to perk up each bite.  The boar ribs were delectable, smeared sticky with a glaze of honey and sambal.  They were tender and meaty with a lot of bold flavor.  The ribs came in a pile, served with blue cheese in a crumble and a sauce, with a celery and daikon slaw to lighten things up.  They were a definite highlight of the meal.But the real fun came in the straight barbecue portion of our dinner, when we got all the meats and sauces and a la carte sides.  We ordered the natural Black Angus brisket, the housemade jalapeño hot links, the half local chicken, and the Niman Ranch ribeye.  There were no duds in this spread.  The brisket was tender with a nice crust, rubbed in brown sugar and coffee.  The hot links had a great snap and a deep, gratifying smokiness.  I wasn't excited about the chicken, but it was moist and flavorful, with a pleasant achiote and lime rub.  The best dish of the night, though, was the mustard and brown sugar crusted ribeye, served with a whole roasted garlic bulb.  That was one of the best steaks I've had in recent memory, a perfect tender medium rare that spilled flavor with every easy chew.  The sweet and pungent cloves of soft garlic did nothing to hurt its case.We enjoyed our meats with Lamberts' trio of housemade sauces, a traditional barbecue, a mustard with ketchup and jalapeño, and a hot sauce made with habanero and red jalapeño.  I couldn't pick a favorite, so I used them all.  For our sides, we had the baked mac and three cheeses, the fried okra with spicy remoulade, and the sautéed lemon spinach.  The mac and cheese was particularly impressive.  Lamberts has a good recipe, one I wish they would share with restaurants closer to home.  The noodles were cooked firm, and the gooey cheese was full of flavor.  The okra and spinach were nice vegetable sides, but not really essential to the meal.For dessert, we had red plum fried pie, warm ricotta cheesecake, and fancy banana pudding.  Dessert was not the high point of the meal, but it was still very good.  The plum fried pie was warm and tart, with a heavy turnover crust dusted with powdered sugar.  It was served with candied corn kernels and fresh slices of plum, along with a summer corn ice cream, supposedly.  If there was ice cream on that plate, it was the melted sweet sauce on the side, and I don't mean that in a disparaging way - I just think the kitchen left out that component.  The pie was still good, but I missed the ice cream.  The cheesecake in a glass was a better dessert, with a honey pine nut crust and a topping of local peach preserves.  Not too sweet, with a great spoonable texture.  My favorite, though, was the banana pudding with Nilla wafers, caramelized Krispies, and cashew cream.  It was sweet and creamy and loaded with banana.I loved all the barbecue we ate in Austin, and though I'd recommend Lamberts behind Salt Lick and Franklin's, it was perfect for upscale barbecue.  I would love to eat here again.","Kona, HI",47,129,129,"[26.0, 50.0, 27.0, 22.0, 4.0]",Oct-10,120,36,53,"['Elite 2021', '’20', '’19', '’18', '’17']"

For sides, I recommend the baked mac and cheese or waffle fries. I ordered the beef sandwich with baked mac and cheese and it was very tasty. The BBQ on the table helps bring out the flavors too. My bill was just $20 after a generous tip for lunch.2) Environment: There's plenty of seating from tables to booths. It's a great spot for a work lunch or dinner too. They can accommodate groups.3) Service: It's friendly without being pushy and they are fast!

The garlic bulb was roasted to perfection that you can squeeze it out and spread it like butter. Yup, Brie said spread it all over the ribeye.

Almost every item had an element of spice from medium to very hot, so I had to get a lot of things on the sideWhole Black Angus Short Rib was delicious, but at $47 it wasn't really worth it as more than half my bites were ALL fat, which just isn't my thing (but seasoning and char was fantastic)Mom's hanger steak was ordered medium and came out medium-well. She didn't mind so she didn't bother to tell the waitress.Mashed Potatoes was almost all cheese & sour cream. Though those are delicious, it's not what you want out of a bite of mashed potatoes.Baked Beans were overly sweet, which isn't my jam, but they were still really good.So even my cons are kind of pros... oh well.If you want a very full tummy and 1-2 good drinks, expect to spend about $70 pp - that's pricey for some folks, but it was downtown and IMO it was worth every penny.

Either way, I took a seat at the bar, which was nice, but not very spacious. Since this was more of a snack based on a full meal, I had only had the appetite to try a sample of a few dishes. Their menu is quite simple and laid out in a way where making a decision is not to difficult. I ended up with a sample of brisket, collard greens, waffle fries, and a glass of divine Cava. Again, touching on the fact that no one was really in the restaurant, my food took awhile to arrive, which was odd. When it did, it was very disappointing, especially for the price I had paid. The serving portions were small, and lackluster. The brisket was very dry and pretty tough to chew on, and when you are in brisket country and lack the ability to serve quality brisket, it is a true shame. The collard greens were alright, but a little bland and last but not least the waffle fries, which may of saved the meal.

There were a few strong contenders. The biggest qualifications we were looking for were: distance from our hotel and star rating. This led us to Lambert's Downtown. Prominently on a corner in the heart of the city, blues music from a local musician was blaring. It was loud in there, and my son was the only person under the age of 21 in the place. He didn't care. When we went to ask for a table, we were told it was an hour wait. But, at the bar it's first come - first serve, and a couple was just leaving. We jumped at their seats! My son ordered the half bird. It was cooked to perfection and the bartender suggested some of their house mustard which was a little bit spicy but perfect with the chicken my son ordered. My son agreed and gobbled up every bit he could. I had the pulled pork and I have never had anything so moist and tender in my life. It was soaked in their bbq sauce, but it was not overwhelmingly present. There IS a bit of spice to their sauce, much more than expected, but well worth it for the taste. For the sides, we had brussel sprouts covered in bacon. That was some darn good veggies. Also, the Mac and 3 cheese. It came out looking like a microwaved cheese bowl with burnt crust on top...but it was mouthwateringly delicious. Highly recommended. The atmosphere was great, a classic decor with a modern clientele. It was packed and I didn't venture upstairs to see the band playing, but great music was present throughout.","Winter Park, FL",100,118,89,"[78.0, 26.0, 7.0, 3.0, 4.0]",Feb-15,263,99,187,"['Elite 2021', '’20', '’19', '’18']"

I had driven past it many times as I live in the neighborhood, but had no idea it was a restaurant (I thought it was a catering company).I called in my order over the phone and came to pick it up. My first impression is that it's a very easy restaurant to access with ample parking. Walking through the doors, the smells are amazing and it's very clean. They've taken restrictions with covid with everyone social distancing and clear tarp around the food and checkout station. Everyone was wearing a mask. The BBQ: I got pork ribs and brisket. The pork ribs were tender and flavorful. The brisket was cooked well. The BBQ sauce tasted home-made. It was honestly the best sauce I've had. If it turns out to be store bought, I'll be shocked. The sides: I got the potato salad and Mac and Cheese. Both sides were a little bland in flavor. I'm not taking away any stars though because I put a bit of Cajun seasoning and they were SO good. It was probably personal preference to want them to have a little something extra. The potato salad is egg and mustard based I think and quite tangy. The service was really good. The guy behind the counter was really friendly and patient with me on the phone repeating items when I asked. They serve different specials on the weekends and have a mixture of bbq and fried foods.

I called in an order later in the day, and while Rollin Smoke was running a bit low on supplies, they were able to put together some brisket and pulled pork tacos for me. Star. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?$5.00 for a brisket taco is perfect, especially if, as was the case here, they're filling the thing up with what seemed to be at least a quarter pound of brisket or pulled pork. Star. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?These were good tacos both brisket and pulled pork. I'm a brisket purist at heart, and the flavor here was good in addition to the crust that delivered a particular satisfying crunch when dished up in taco form. My only gripe here if you can call it that is that the tortilla was on the weak side and I could have used with some sort of peripherals in the mix be that peppers or onions or something of the like just to make it something more than brisket and a bit of sauce wrapped in a tortilla. Single Star. Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?Definitely. Rollin Smoke delivers.

Bravo.We were extremely impressed by this wonderful BBQ truck. It's not cheap, but it has a lot going for it. For example, they are extremely friendly. Then there's the size of the sandwich, which is very generous.Then there's the smoky, amazing, juicy flavor, the perfect ingredients which don't taste remotely cheap (which is good, since the sandwich isn't), and the excellent BBQ sauce, none of which we were expecting, because it's food truck food, and honestly my experiences with food truck food in Austin aren't amazing, despite it being one of the food truck capitals of the world, along with maybe Portland Oregon and a few other places.So despite the mid-to-high prices - by Food Truck standards - the sandwich is well worth your money, and packed full of expertly-made, perfectly-seasoned, expensive/fancy-tasting, and more importantly, utterly delicious BBQ meat. I'm not even into meat that much anymore, but I make exceptions when something tastes this good.When you consider how good (and generous) the sandwich is, then the price is actually a steal. This is definitely one of the best five food trucks I've tried in Austin, and it almost makes all the bad ones I tried worthwhile just to have found this one. I'd say Boteco, Sonora Hot Dogs, Hi Tea (now closed), and I can't think of another one I really loved, so those are my fave 4 then.So for sure, we will most definitely be back here in future.Plus they're owned by Henry Rollins and Smokey Robinson (and a bandit), so that just makes them more awesome.It's good that they're always in the same place, which allows us to easily pin down their location at any given time.

The brisket is on the smokier side compared to other places I've been to but it's perfectly tender and moist, although I feel it could use a tad more salt. The pulled pork is juicy and a blast of porcine flavor that pairs well with the BBQ sauce, though of the three meats that make up the sandwich, I think it's the most meh.

Turns out I was in their parking lot. It's a tiny food truck next to a couple other food trucks, with a smoker in the back banging out the best brisket in town. When I showed up, they had no brisket up front, but they were about to take one out of the smoker. The cook went right out, grabbed the meat, and made me a fresh hot sandwich to go. Service: plus. Food: pluuuus. That is some damn good brisket. It has just the right amount of chew before it falls apart in your mouth. I got one piece of fat to juice up a sandwich that was otherwise made of meat (and pickles and onions). I got the bourbon sauce, and it blended in well - can't say I noticed any flavor other than deep and smoky, but hey, that's what I wanted with my sammy. The spicy slaw is really good.

I'd say the brisket was pretty good - smokey and not too dry.  It's not top tier - but it's solid.* Turkey.  On the last go the turkey was amazing - smokey, but so tender, soft and juicy.  Definitely ranked as some of the best turkey in town.  * St. Louis Ribs.  These ribs are probably my favorite of the things they do - sweet sauce glazed on this fall of the bone goodness.  * Baby Back Ribs.  These are two on my list - rubbed to perfection and not quite as sweet as the St. Louis.  They lack the meat cap and cartilage on the back, but are tender and tasty.* Potato Salad.  This was a thumbs up - great compliment to the BBQ* Street Corn.  These have a little kick but were a pleaser as well.All meat comes with some onion, pickles and bread too.  EDIT:  Forgot to mention - the BBQ sauce has a vinegar base to it so you're going to get a pretty sharp tang to it.  The acidity works well with fatty cuts of brisket.Service is quick and nice (cordial and appreciative).  Great local BBQ joint for S.

I was a mindless zombie with an intense meat craving combing through yelp on the comfort of my couch to find the next BBQ place that I can attack. While searching for a bit, the holy grail finally appeared to me in the form of Big Vinny's BBQ. It was at that moment that I grabbed my keys and headed off to the wonderland. But little did I know, Satan's asshole was leaking that day and the heat was pounding at me. But that did not stop my hungry soul while I drove to the wonderland in my car, butt scorching from the seat and hands avoiding anything that looked like metal.The service:The service is exactly what you would get at a food truck. You walk up to the window and then Big Vinny say in a jolly manner: ""What can I get yah?"" with a smile on his face. (This is how my brain interpreted it and may not reflect what actually happened) My only issue was that there was not a garbage can outside. Please put one out so I can do my citizens duty.The Food:FRITO PIE: As I opened up the to-go container, a bright light shined from it and what I saw was a reflection of my life. It was a meat galore with brisket, sausage, beans, fritos, and cheese. The brisket was great and the pieces I had seemed like it was a fattier cut. The sausage was also fantastic. As I bit into the sausage, the meat juice practically exploded from it. That's what I wanted to feel, a real Niagra Falls flowing in my mouth. My only wish with the Frito Pie was that I wish it was a bit more warmed up and the cheese slightly melted.POTATO SALAD: The potato salad is grainer than others. I prefer a smoother potato salad, but this one stands on its own two feet.PORK RIBS: THIS WAS nslfnsd2mp3dp23. That's how I felt when I bit into the rib. I actually might've malfunctioned in real life for a split second. The meat just came off the bone. It was both juicy and delicious.All in all, the food was great, however, It lacked the depth to make it 5 star worthy. It's almost there though.

I was going to give a 1 star review but always give another try on the chance it was a one-off cluster of mistakes I experience and not a normal one. I'm glad I did. Rudy's you could say has the formula down for fast food BBQ. They're not about customer service, not to say its bad  just not there bc its all a la carte. You pick-up your sauce, pickles, onions yourself (they're free, no upsell like chik-fil-a for more sauce or the like). They give you a 3-4 slices of bread per 1/2 lb of meat ordered. 4 orders = whole loaf included. I ordered delivery through Uber Eats (not carried on Favor). Just a heads up to contact your Uber Eats driver ASAP to let them know to pick-up the already pre-packaged accroutrements of BBQ sauce, pickles, and onions over to the side of the ordering counter. Rudy's doesn't deal with on-line orders so the Uber Eats person is responsible for getting it themselves. I ordered 1/2 lb moist brisket, 1/2 lb pulled park, full rack St. Louis Ribs, bananna pudding, cream corn, and baked beans. Lets start with the brisket, its an easy one. The flavor is lightly seasoned, not salty, with a very distinct and bright pink/red smoke ring. The shell is sticky with carmelized to burnt at the thin parts. The seasoned taste is from the shell with a thin fat layer that keeps its crust wet and sticky and the meat very wet. Moist is not the best descriptor here, wet, is best. The meat is very very tender as such you will not need a knife. A fork or fingers will suffice just fine. There sauce is a spicy tang type so it pairs well with these dry rubbed brisket. Next lets talk pig, pulled pork. Was very thick, the chew was not easy but very tasty. I recommend this be spread thin on the bread with extra sauce. I tasted the rub, a bit salty, but thats expected seeing its been pulled and mixed and kept warm till serving. I imagine, not sure, that with the volume Rudy serves not everyone gets the pulled pork right after its been pulled and mixed. Some, I think like me, get it much much later after its been sitting and warmly slow cooking. It was okay, but not worth the price and not recommended to try. The St. Louis ribs were cut short, as a full rack is in my experience at least 8 falls I got 7 with a very burnt unedible charcoaled end. The 7th was tiny, no meat. So in truth 6-1/2 falls at 4in long by 1inch wide. Poor showing for a BBQ joint that charges a premium for slow cooked rubbed ribs. The half rack of the full slab that was sauced and juicy fell off the bone perfectly and gave a light push back to the bite as opposed to being mushed. The meat was very well smoked as being lightly rouge of pink shade. The caramelized sugar shell went well with a butter pickle chip and piece of white onion, I recommend the ribs but check them before you walk away from the counter, don't pay their premium prices for unedible meat. Next up, the cream corn, do it, try it its thick, not to sweet and crunches at each kernel, definitely recommended. The beans are a bit looser than typical (typical for me is like bushes baked beans, thick). It has a savory vinegar taste similar to the water in the slow cooked southern collard greens. There are small tastes of ham in the beans and slight kick of mustard flavor. These pair well with the pulled pork with the sweet and sour like tastes. The 4ounce cold bananna pudding is topped with a malty whipped cream and 4 vanilla wafers. Its very thick and neutralizes any spices in your mouth or overly onion and pickled stomach. Just a heads-up their sweet tea is very 'southern' sweet tea as to say super sweet. Add lemon and suggest 1/2 the cup be un-sweet tea to calm it down. The delivery takes an hour to hour 15min, don't be fooled by the 30-45min quote on uber eats. Never ever that quick with Rudys. Its expensive just looking at the food prices vs portions and quality of product. I will come again for lean brisket and try their baby back ribs next time. I recommend you try Rudys and email me your review would love to read your opinion.","Austin, TX",0,26,35,"[4.0, 14.0, 5.0, 3.0, 0.0]",Jul-11,4,4,2,['never']

Everything was packaged up nicely and tight. We even ordered from their grocery items they have on their website right now that included flour, sugar, bread, tortillas(!), and even toilet paper!!! Saved us one trip to the grocery store for even the smallest things.  Picking up your order was super easy too!  We parked in the back, called the main line, and let them know what parking spot we were located in. Pop your trunk or roll down the back window and they will place the bag and your order in for you.  Super easy peasy!  It did make me sad that we couldn't enjoy eating our food out on their lawn/patio area like we used to when we came before quarantine.

My absolute favorite was the brisket! It was seasoned to perfection and soooo tender. The ribs were falling off the bone and so delicious. The prime rib was outshined by the other two meats. I also picked up a cup of banana pudding for dessert and it was very creamy and not too sweet. I could eat that pudding with every meal. The dining room is set up family picnic style with long tables. Each area is equipt with seasonings and Rudy's barbecue sauce. The sauce is one of the best bbq sauces I've had. It is super peppery and tangy, just the way I like it! You can even purchase bottles of the sauce to use at home. Overall, I had a great time here. It is a laid back feel and you eat everything on a piece of wax paper. The food was high quality and shockingly tender. I will definitely be coming back...every week...! Check out Rudy's if you are in need of gas and some food.","Tampa, FL",192,765,1138,"[336.0, 261.0, 104.0, 44.0, 20.0]",May-11,861,295,408,"['Elite 2021', '’20', '’19', '’18', '’17', '’16']"

Rudy's is situated at a gas station, which truly brings a countryside character out of this place.On MLK morning, there was no line nor crowd here at all. I'm not sure if it's usually like this, but I sure appreciated not needing to wait. Plus, there is so much seating area with extra room and space for the customers. As a first timer, the cashier welcomed me and my friends with some samples. This was really neat, which allowed us to actually make an informed decision on which meat to order rather than being stuck with pounds of meat we might not like. We were able to sample the turkey, brisket, and extra moist brisket. The minute I tried the extra moist brisket, I knew that was what I was getting. Also, they offer tacos here which was nice because one of my friend was all BBQ'd out.My friend and I shared 0.5lbs of extra moist brisket ($9.29), half rack of baby back ribs ($9.99), cole slaw ($2.34), and creamed corn ($2.64). We weren't too hungry, so this was the perfect amount for the two of us. I absolutely loved the brisket here. It was so tender, juicy, and thinly sliced to make for an easier bite. As for the baby back ribs, they were rather okay to me and on the smaller side. Even though the meat was delicious, my favorite was their sides here. The cole slaw was light and refreshing, but the creamed corn was just heavenly. The corn is extra creamy and definitely on the thicker consistency, but so freaking delicious!All of their pickles, onions, sauces are self serve on the side counter, which is very convenient. Also, they have the coolest machine to wash your hands. You just stick your hands in the buckets and it cleans and soaps your hands. Afterwards, you can even get a sticker that says ""I have clean hands."" This was super cool --more places definitely need something like this.Overall, bomb BBQ (yes to the extra moist brisket and creamed corn) and great service.

He told us it looked like we almost ate the entire rib. When we said there was barely any meat and what little meat there was was inedible, he then effectively scolded us for not ordering the dinner portion beef ribs and said that the lunch portion ribs weren't as meaty and that beef ribs are tougher in general. There was no apology whatsoever except from our wonderful waiter.That was our first experience with the GM and likely our last. Every server has taken such great care of us over the years and then for the GM to rudely question our integrity and insult us was unacceptable. Mr. Hood, your 27 years of experience was not on display today. Questioning and lecturing the customer will never work and you've lost a longtime customer.

Because it's there.The mountain of banana pudding is made even more mountainous by absolutely Texan quantities of whipped cream.This is real whipped cream not fake whipped cream, and it is lightly sweetened, and wonderful.They use teeny tiny but highly flavorful Vanilla Wafers.The banana pudding itself is light, creamy and wonderful.Overall, I was in Himalayan Banana Pudding Heaven.You normally don't see anyone going ""Shakti, Shakti, Shakti"" at a Texas BBQ place.But somehow it seemed like the right thing to do.* * *There are those people who seek happiness by seeking riches.There are those people who seek happiness by seeking fame.There are those people who seek happiness by bedding beautiful women.(Come to think of it, that is not a bad back-up plan at all.)Nevertheless, I say you should seek happiness by eating Banana Pudding at Brown's BBQ.Not only does the pudding taste incredibly good.But I can promise you that if you eat enough of those Banana Pudding Mountains,You will definitely experience personal growth.Hey, the Buddha is fat and happy.You can be fat and happy too.","Austin, TX",193,1110,0,"[375.0, 425.0, 203.0, 67.0, 40.0]",May-11,5212,3832,4033,"['Elite 2021', '’20', '’19', '’18', '’17', '’16', '’15', '’14']"

I got there at 1:30 p.m. on a Wednesday and ordered a half-pound each of brisket and sausage. When the lady pulled out the brisket to carve, it had that perfect Jello shake, beautiful bark and scintillating smoke ring. It was moist and delicious, perfectly seasoned with a divine hint, not overpowering, of smoky perfection. Nothing interfered with its beefy essence. And, impossible as it seems, the sausage was even better! I think it's pure beef, a relatively fine grind, with a peppery finish, spicy but not hot. The sides were also special: smooth, creamy bacon mac and cheese and braised cabbage with bacon with both a sweetness, like caramelized onion and a peppery note. And the people couldn't be nicer.

We drove around the lonely streets of Austin, and voila! A little red shack with a big smell caught our senses. Enter Iron Works BBQ. The interior of the restaurant was old creaky wood, open seating tables and signed celebrity photos on the walls from years of meat-filled visitations. There was a good-sized patio with clear marine-vinyl windows, in addition to the roomy interior. Mr. P ordered a half rack and a soda. I opted for the pulled pork plate, with cole slaw and beans.

But check it out: it's back, and it's even better after its latest makeover!A few inner walls are missing, along with the back porch screen enclosure and the wide stage, which has moved indoors. But all of the cool Johnny Cash kitsch, downtown Austin vibe remains, along with a friendly, efficient staff. And the new open layout is very Feng Shui, which only helps the vibe flow freely, both indoors and out back to the rows of picnic tables. I'm beyond thrilled that my wish for food in my previous review has been granted, by none other than Austin's own STUBB'S BBQ!

There's a nice selection of quality beers, not just the usual boring Lite or Bock fare you often find.  Prices are reasonable. The only improvement I would make is to have them serve food of some kind.  Just fries or even bags of nuts and chips.  But they don't, so you'll need to eat first or step out later for a bite at El Arroyo across the street or the sushi place up the block.Parking is a snap even though there's a tiny lot, because the garage behind them is open at night, and currently doesn't charge for parking.  The location right on 5th next to MoPac makes this place easy to find.","Kyle, TX",13,3,0,[],Jun-12,0,3,0,['never']

He lives near San Antonio, I live near Austin, and we often meet at one of our favorite spots to visit with each other and check up on a place in our Top Five List. One of my newest top fives is Jim's Smokehouse. I'm slow to run through the menu over several visits when I locate a good one, so I can only speak to what I've eaten so far. That said, it takes only a bite of their brisket to indicate the quality of the rest of the fare. If a place has brisket that's been treated right, everything else on the menu supports it. Sides are sides at most spots, and when I want the traditional potato salad, coleslaw, and beans, I know where to go. When I hit a place that vamps on that tradition, and does so with great success, I take note. The said, order the slaw...just do it. I was so taken with Jim's jicama slaw that I brought some home for my wife to try. That right there is sayin' something. The brisket tastes, looks, and otherwise behaves like Prime, but I haven't asked, and it's hard to tell with the Black Angus at Jim's Smokehouse. Some places advertise ""We use Angus beef,"" but Black Angus is different; the marbling is distributed evenly, and a correctly done Black Angus brisket will tower head and shoulders over the best of other brisket breeds, as it does at Jim's.The sausage, made-to-spec in Llano, is a delight; meaty, just the right spice, Texas as all get out. Don't miss it. The sauces are main-course quality...complex, complementary.Jim's has done outdid theirselves with Key Lime Pie and Strawberry ""gravy."" Yes, pie! Grandmother's recipe, done respectfully by a CIA chef. Have a bite of pie, then supper...you will thank me.I should admit here that I have never waited in line to eat at that popular place just off 35 in Austin, though folks I trust tell me it's worth the wait, and I bet it's good and all, but I would have to drive right past Jim's Smokehouse to get there, and so far I just haven't found a reason to do that.","Austin, TX",97,85,7,"[49.0, 20.0, 10.0, 4.0, 2.0]",Mar-10,168,52,33,['never']

No mayo in sight, just fresh, crisp flavors to refresh your palette in between bites. Brilliant.I'll echo all of the other Yelpers: Do yourself a favor and get the key lime pie.

Here's what we went for:-pulled chicken sandwich - 8/10: solid, noms-brisket taco - 11/10: omg loved this-steak fajita taco - 10/10: tad salty but delish-carnitas taco - 10/10: I don't even like pork-potato salad - 8/10: standard sideOk so technically I got the sandwich no bread.. so chicken pile with toppings, but low carb and yummy. I also think it's brilliant if you're wanting to try a bunch of meats, but don't want to commit to a full pound. Loophole!We had already sampled many of the meats as part of our takeout feast, but the brisket was a new add. I took at least 4 bites of my boyfriend's taco innards. SO GOOD.Based on my now cumulative experiences, I'd highly recommend the carnitas, brisket and chicken. Corn and caramelized onions were my toppings of choice.

When you arrive, know that you must put your order in on-line. Check the wait ahead of time, because you can order before you get there, so you can time your food to be ready when it's convenient.  Our first visit was on a Sunday. It was an hour wait, we almost left, but the reviews made us stay. I hope I can encourage you to do the same! I ordered a pulled pork taco and brisket taco for myself. My husband had the brisket (moist) with corn tortillas. (Gluten free meal). We split the street corn. First, the brisket. Oh how amazing. It is so tender, it completely falls apart. Each little sliver of brisket packs so much flavor, and when they are combined into one bite, you'll realize it was worth the wait. Smoky, salty, flavor drenched brisket. It's the best I've ever had. The tacos are delicious, simple and flavorful. A good way to sample several meats of you don't want to commit to buying meat by the pound. The street corn was probably some of the best I've ever had, spicy, flavorful. We also got the chips and queso. The chips are phenomenal and the queso.... Yipes it was good. It was spicy, packed with several cheeses, the chips are made fresh. I would have been happy with the chips and queso alone, (except now I know how good their BBQ is). This visit inspired another a few days later on the way to the Austin airport. This time we got more brisket, spicy sausage, and ribs, as well as potato salad. The potato salad was good, fresh, with firm potatoes, refreshing on a hot day. The ribs fell off the bone. Usually I expect BBQ sauce on my ribs, and we had some on the side, but I didn't use it because these ribs were smoked with so much flavor, they held their own!The spicy sausage had a great flavor, texture, wonderful. But the star of the show, the leading lady, will always be the brisket. Standing ovation.

We'd picked it up with our family a little late and didn't get enough because when they sell out, they're done.This year we wanted something special for New Year's Eve so we placed a to-go order at 7:30 am, right when they open. I picked up brisket, ribs, sausage and sides of corn, Charro beans and slaw at about 8:30 in pouring rain. I was hungry when I got home and tempted to have some BBQ for breakfast. It smelled amazingly good. I stuck to my guns though and put it in the fridge for dinner. We warmed it up for dinner (meat in the oven, sides in the microwave) and it was well worth the wait. The brisket was incredible: tender and really tasty. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone cooked and just marvelous. The sausage had a nice taste and was just spicy enough. Their corn was really amazing. Grilled with Mexican style flavors it tasted terrific. The beans and slaw were very good too. As a transplanted New Yorker, I consider myself a bit more picky about BBQ than most Texans as I discovered it later in life. I consider this some of the very best I've ever eaten and highly recommend this place (but order it early or you might miss out).","Austin, TX",11,5,1,"[2.0, 0.0, 2.0, 0.0, 1.0]",Sep-16,1,0,0,['never']

We come here often on the weekend and this was the first time we visited on a weekday.Usually the rooftop is available for seating but as we walked to the rooftop an employee stoped us and rudely told us the rooftop was closed. She did not offer any other seating options and walked away. This seemed odd because we saw another couple kindly offered other seating options. No where was it stated that the rooftop was closed as it is a seat yourself establishment.We decided to stay and found other seats and ordered the bottomless mimosas. Because we come here often, we expected 2 glasses but the server only brought one. We asked for another glass, she aggressively stated that it's one per person. As someone in the service industry, i understand. My boyfriend only planned he would just have one and then ordered a single. The server then came to the table and scolded us and told us we needed to order 2 bottomless which seemed unreasonable for someone who wanted one mimosa. Then we we finally decided to leave and cancel our order, both her and the bartender argued with us that we had to pay even though the appetizer and drink never reached our table. Again, as a service industry worker, she could have reused the simple champagne and orange juice mixture because we never touched it and everyone in the establishment is drinking mimosas and it was most likely premixed. This was a long ordeal for a meal that was under $30. This was only resolved because the owner was there but we did not speak with them.

We asked for them to turn it back on and they were happy to do so.There is a small bar on the patio but the more comprehensive one is downstairs which you can also order from. A few of my friends ordered beers. I was pretty chilled so I asked if there were any hot beverages. The server let me know that they have a hot toddy which has alcohol in it. I braced myself for harsh judgments when I asked if there were any hot non-alcoholic drinks. Instead he was super apologetic because he thought he misinterpreted me and ran downstairs to ask if there was tea or coffee available. He came back up and reported that there wasn't but instead he could just fix me up a hot honey lemon drink as an alternative. He had to run back downstairs and up again with the drink.

Great location, great patio (if you're in the shade), and delicious TX comfort food! The food is actually really delicious...heavy as hell...but very good! We had these items:1. Honey & habanero wings: 5/52. queso with brisket & jalapenos: so good! 5/53. Eastside sliders with slaw: 5/54. Eastside benedict: 5/5Overall, the food was absolutely delicious. Again, very heavy, but if that's what you're going for then check this place out! They also do bottomless mimosas for $14 which is super cheap. This is why I'm giving this place 2 stars:It's a toasty 90-degree day in ATX on a second-floor patio with 0 shade. I definitely think the table spots that are completely exposed needed misters. It was ungodly hot and people who are pale would be a lobster at the end of this brunch. Onto the main story!...We came here because the menu looked amazing and we wanted Texas comfort food, which is what we got from this place. However, the service was absolutely horrendous. I've never experienced anything like it. The manager, Brie, treated us really well during this experience. She went around to us and the surrounding tables to fix all of the screw-ups from the waitress. There was only 1 server for the whole upstairs patio and it was hot as hell, so I felt really bad for this waitress, in the beginning. Wearing a mask in 90-degree weather is horrible. We felt really bad for her in the beginning because it looked pretty miserable serving champagne and food to everyone in that weather.  It really did look like a challenging job. The waitress did warn us saying things were running slow, so be prepared. We thought how bad can it be....it was really bad! It turned into a 3-hour brunch. Our wings came out immediately, but our queso came out completely wrong without the brisket or jalapenos so we waited for the server to put that in. After the first screw up, she tells us to tell her manager what a great job she was doing....which was weird. After that, We waited almost two hours for our food and we finally asked where the hell our food was. She literally looks at us like we didn't even order food after we saw her write it down on paper. She couldn't remember what we ordered and didn't have anything on the paper.  She tells us she put it in the computer after we confronted her. We waited another 30 min and still no food. The manager finally comes and says, did you get your food? NO, we've been waiting 2 hours for TX toast, cheese, and bbq. It was insane! The manager finally brings our food, but the order was still wrong and at this point, we were over it and sunburnt. Meanwhile, at this point, I'm convinced the waitress was on drugs or drunk. She brings us our bill and nothing was fixed or comped. She charged us for items we didn't even get to eat. She just asked for our credit card and she's about to charge us. We finally speak up telling her we shouldn't have to pay for these items since we've been at brunch, not by choice. The manager comes by and says we shouldn't be paying for any of these items. She comped everything for us which was very sweet of her.  AFTER ALL OF THIS, the waitress comes over and says the manager fired me. Damn right she fired you, it was a terrible experience. AGAIN, if you want delicious food and bottomless mimosas then this is the place for you. I do think management did a great job fixing this issue, but they definitely need better servers.","Austin, TX",12,83,8,"[43.0, 4.0, 24.0, 8.0, 4.0]",Jul-13,87,24,23,"['Elite 2021', '’20', '’19']"

Somehow they were able to make this dish way too spicy. We would have finished this off if they were more careful to tone down the spice.- fried pickles ($6): my brother and I were only barely able to nibble on these since it was way too salty unfortunately. the fried pickle spears from Austin's 24 Diner were juicier, and therefore better.- pickled deviled eggs ($6): sweet, tangy, but also had too much mayo. It stood out for being pink/purplish in color due to the pickled nature. Was it the best in Austin?

Additionally, I think I enjoyed more the tiny salad bed it was on (wished the salad was more plentiful!)- smoked chicken wings ($8): a tad little on the dry and tough side even with the wet marinade, but good flavor (we picked BBQ sauce over Buffalo, the only two options). Also came with the dipping sauce options of ranch or blue cheese dressing - but ranch dressing sometimes has blue cheese, so I thought it was weird that they only offered those two choices on the menu. Upon inquiring, they also have honey mustard which I thought was good (hope this tip is helpful for those who are not a fan of ranch or blue cheese).During happy hour, these were all offered at good prices. However, we weren't able to eat much because of the noted flops. The atmosphere was good, the waitress wasn't very accommodating for the deaf, the food presentation was lovely, but I think this is definitely much more of a beer garden (with wine and cocktail offerings) than a good place to eat as it would be tough for me to recommend others to come here at normal pricing until execution is improved (I'm still tempted to try the reasonable-sounding turkey avocado toast but it's only offered during weekend brunch - an unfortunate shame).","Austin, TX",577,2138,1824,"[514.0, 880.0, 467.0, 185.0, 92.0]",Aug-05,6612,2363,3406,"['Elite 2021', '’20', '’19', '’18', '’17', '’16', '’15', '’14', '’13', '’12', '\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 more years as an Elite\n\n']"

There were 4 of us who had gotten there first and had others on the way. There wasn't a big enough table to seat all of us at the time so the older male host with a beard allowed us to sit at two close tables for the time being. We may had been there maybe 10-15 min. Ordered food and mimosas. Our apps and drinks had arrived and while there are two tables with two of us each sitting at a table, we decided to not speak across the tables so we wouldn't interrupt other guest. The older male hostess comes running over just yelling at us about how we cannot move tables. We didn't physically move any tables. We just thought for the time being, the 4 of us would sit together while our other friends parked instead of talking between tables. We understand covid rules and the idea to be safe but the male hostess was being irrational and claimed we were cut from the bar when we had just gotten there and hadn't even finished one drink. We explained to him our side and he wasn't havent it and berated us condescending things. We asked what we did wrong and what a solution could be to solve such a thing and wow, I've never met a more unreasonable person ever. We proceeded to go close out and he followed us to the bar. Not practicing social distancing at all being so close to us like we were criminals and would try and steal something. As I try to finish the 9/10th left of what I had to drink, he berated us again but this time over a mask. Not sure how I can drink a drink I paid for through my mask but alright sure. He was a dick. I truly understand these are tough and strange times especially for the restaurants industry but to handle a situation like this is absurd and sad. I do hope this issue is addressed with this individual because he will single handily drive out business away during these tough times. Complete power trip and every bartender just looked at us completely shocked as to what was going on as we closed out our tabs because they knew, we hadn't even had one finished drink...sad the other staff members have to suffer from one individual on a power trip and didn't even have the decency to give a solution to the problem he apparently had.

But it was so worth it, especially when paired with the house BBQ sauce and the pickles, onions, and bread provided for make-your-own sandwiches. The meat was the most flavor-filled meat I've ever had and was moist and melted in your mouth. All meat is priced by weight so you can really cater how much or how little you are willing to eat/pay.

The exterior looks a bit like a barn which is neat, and there's quite a bit of parking if you're driving. The interior is massive and there's community seating within so it really sort of feels like a picnic in a park.

(I'm looking at you, Miller's Smokehouse.)  The ribs were well done, had a great smoke ring, and a heavy crust of pepper.  And as always, Rudy's sauce is good, even if it's not as spicy as I remember it being initially.  Also, as always, Rudy's has great iced tea and soft drinks.It's actually relatively easy to serve good BBQ.  A bit of salt and pepper and the right amount of time in the pit or smoker will make you famous.  But Rudy's has a lot of the current trendy places beat for two reasons.  One.  Consistency.  It's going to taste the same almost every time you go to Rudy's.  No worrying about whether they're having an off day.  Two.

These guys are serving up some righteous BBQ.We ordered via their online App for a noon pick up and had to wait an additional 20 minutes for our order, but it was well worth the wait.We ordered brisket and ribs. The brisket was tender as could be, not mushy and had an excellent bark that held the meat together perfectly.The pork ribs are large meaty and do not fall off the bone, which is good. A little tug will do ya to separate the perfectly smoked meat from the bone.They do provide a lite BBQ sauce that only adds to the goodness. You do not need to add BBQ sauce to their meat but a little dab will do ya. I like this sauce as it is not heavy and does not overpower the meat.They did forget to add beans to our order so dag nabbit we will have to return!

Interstellar had good reviews so I went by to give them a try. I went inside and started looking over the selections written in chalk on the boards on the wall behind the register. I was looking for a bake potatoes and meat plates. When I got to the register I asked if they had bake potatoes and was told no, they have never sold bake potatoes. Then, I asked if they had meat plates and was also told no. So, I first chose to order 1/2 lb ribs that were listed at $13.00 but when the person that was helping me sliced them and it was only two ribs I changed my mind. After looking at the menu again I asked if they only had beef sausage and was told yes outside of the jalapeño sausage listed. Though it was pricey as well, I then asked if I could get brisket with mostly fatty meat and was told yes...as I wanted to get something after driving over there...so I got 1/2 lb brisket which equated to 2 slices of brisket but he added a 3rd half end piece that took it a little over 1/2 lb. When I went to check out, I was offered complimentary bread, pickles and onions then beans. I don't remember what the brisket was per lb but my total came to $16.61. OUCH!!! Now, the only reason I am giving them 4 stars it because the brisket was as I asked and it was DARN GOOD!!! I gave the beans to my Mother and she said they were also good. Unfortunately, when in Austin again I won't be going back with the prices and minimum options.

They have a legendary Austin culinary heritage that has put this place on my radar ever since they opened (RIP Noble Pig). My friend and I after a friendly match of tennis decided to come here for our fatty lunch and to compensate for our calories burned and then some and boy was it worth the long drive.We decided to basically just try all the meats so here's what we got/liked in order of preference. Their house pickles are great and refreshing, and the both their sauces are good pending on what you like. I personally liked the red one more for the tomato base and less up front vinegary tang but if you like something more bracing and mustardy, go for the yellow. Anyways, on with the meat: 1. The sausage - I don't remember the name of the sausage we got (it was their special of the day), but oh boy was it flavorful. There's a little spice, some cheese and some other flavors in there that made it plenty nice. The texture was smooth and fatty without being overwhelming either. Best sausage I think I've had from any bbq joint.2. The ribs - The flavor on the rub is pretty insane - I guarantee you do not need sauce on these. It's sweet, peppery and despite relatively thin ribs, not overly salty. In other words, it tingles about every taste bud in your mouth just right. The only reason why it's not #1 on this list is the batch we got I think could have used a little more time on the smoker for slightly more tenderness.3. The brisket - moist brisket is the way to go and it's soaking the paper when it hits the plate. That said, it's surprisingly not too fatty when you start eating it. Again, mostly black pepper flavor with a lighter hand on the salt. I don't think their brisket needs sauce if you're a purist, but I would recommend a little because of the fat content so that the acid cuts the grease a bit.4. The chicken - red pepper chicken is definitely unique, so we decided to try it. They sell the chicken in quarters only and while the chicken is plenty juicy, I can say I've definitely had better flavor wise. I would pass on this unless you just want meat as a vehicle for their sauce.Yet in spite of all of the praise on the meat, it's arguable that the best things I ate at Interstellar were the sides. I don't know what ranches the owners have been on, but if I grew up on one of those ranches with a pot of beans like that, I would never have left the side of the pot. These ranch style beans are free on the house and by far the best beans I've had anywhere. And let's be frank: it's basically chili. It's thick and has lots of beans but there is a heaping helping of pulled/shredded meat in there that gives it that thick consistency. It's sweet, meaty, hearty, homeyness all in one bite. And honestly, if you wanted a cheap lunch, I would just buy a sausage and slather the chili on top of some white bread for arguably the best chili dog you'll have in your life. But that's JUST THE BEANS. Let's shine some love on that smoked scalloped potato too - well shingled, creamy potato casserole that's firm, yet delicate with just enough smokiness to evoke a fire roasted bake potato kinda taste. I wish this was at my thanksgiving spread every year...Lastly, the teas are really good too - peach tea is a summer dream but the brown sugar sweet tea is perfection in a glass as it's not too sweet but also has some more caramel like characteristics that take your taste buds on a ride that's way more complex than the usual one dimensional sweetness you get from other sweet teas. Don't get me wrong, regular sweet tea with the simple syrup is still sweet tea and awesome, but at my age where you have to worry about your sugar intake and have to weigh the pros and cons of intaking said amount of sugar, this would be one of my few exceptions worthy to drink.So in a nut shell, great meats, great sides, great service, great sauce - what's not to like? Interstellar BBQ may not be among the best known bbq joints in Austin [yet] but enjoy it while you can before the lines get brutal :).","Austin, TX",1,3,1,[],Apr-14,0,0,0,['never']

I will start the story from the beginning, so that you can all be fairly informed.We hired John and Noble Catering fairly early into our wedding planning. We got married in December of 2020 and we hired them in January of 2020.We sent them our deposit that secured over 220 plates of food. Fast forward to November of 2020. I sent an email on the 18th to ask questions and get clarification on a few details for vendor meals so that we could submit our final guest count in time for an adjusted final payment ahead of the date due on our contract, which was November 28th. On November 20th, John answered the questions that I had and we submitted out final guest count on November 23rd, five days before the requested date. My now husband called multiple times that week to make our final payment, including November 25th, 27th and 28th. On the 27th, My husband was informed by someone at Interstellar BBQ that John would call back by the end of the business day. We never received a phone call. NEVER.We followed up with an email on December 2nd, asking if they had received our email or our multiple messages left with employees because we were less than 10 days from our wedding at this point!!!!! We were, honestly, very worried about not having food at our wedding. We reached out to our venue and our wedding planner to see if there was any way that they could help us contact him, because no matter what we did, we could not seem to get ahold of him or anyone at Noble Catering.After reaching out to our venue and wedding planner for help in this matter, he FINALLY responded with an email on December 4th stating that he was sorry for the slow response, but the restaurant was on a holiday break and he had been out of the office, but that he would get us an updated total for the new guest count by that evening or first thing in the morning. On December 5th, ONE WEEK before our wedding, by 2pm that Saturday, we still had not received an updated cost or made final payment for our catering. We sent our termination of services email that day stating that we would no longer be needing his services and that we would be requesting a full refund.John emailed back almost immediately, stating that it was unfortunate, but that he would be checking the contract to see if he would be sending us a refund or not.Fast forward to December 11th, he sent us email asking where he could send a refund check to and we gave him our home address.As of January 6th, we still had not received a refund check, so we followed up asking when we might be receiving it, not wanting over $2200 to come up missing. He responded on the 7th, stating that he was going to be dropping it in the mail that day.It is now February 12, 2021 and I still don't have a refund check that was supposed to be mailed over a month ago!Thank the lord above for Pecan Springs Ranch owner Judy Smith, who was able to secure us a caterer last minute. The food was delicious and was raved about all night. Thanks to PEJ Events who was able to throw a whole menu together in 6 days. Save your time, energy and money and go with another caterer. Literally anyone else. Wedding planning is far too stressful to be dealing with the nonsense that we had to one week before ours and I want to save another couple from having to deal with it too.","New Braunfels, TX",3,32,1,"[6.0, 4.0, 7.0, 3.0, 12.0]",Oct-13,42,16,12,['never']

Always smells wonderful. I told the cutter it was my first timer and he introduced himself as John.  He made a couple of suggestions. I ordered the whole burnt end of the brisket that was sitting there and 2 of the ribs he had just unwrapped.  Another employee suggested the smoked scalloped potatoes.    Meal was served on butcher paper on an aluminum try which to me is a good sign of true Texas BBQ.  The meal included house made pickles and pickled onions.  They also serve 3 flavors of tea and bbq beans. The brown sugar tea is excellent and unique.  Different flavor from traditional sweet tea.  The beans were good but had a little too much chili power in them for my taste.  But it didn't prevent me from eating 3 boats of them.  They were good after all.  Loved the pickles and onions.  Not over powering and different from others I have had in the area.  The smoked scalloped potatoes had an amazing flavor. It's a must order.I sampled both sauces on the table.  Neither one was to my personal taste.  Everyone around me seem to really enjoy them though.  To me, good BBQ doesn't need sauce.  Well, I was not disappointed.  The burnt ends were some of the best I have ever tasted.  They still retained a layer of fat that just melted in my mouth.  The meat was so tender it almost fell apart with a little urging from a plastic fork.  As tender as a nicely cooked roast should be.  Amazing.  The ribs were nice with lots of meat and a familiar flavor I couldn't identify at that time.  I'm going to ask about the rub on my next visit.Overall, Interstellar BBQ is a top notch example of Texas BBQ.  If you want a true taste of what barbecue is supposed to taste like, you must try them out.  Interstellar BBQ is definitely in the top 5 of my ""Keepers List"".","Cedar Park, TX",191,18,9,"[14.0, 0.0, 0.0, 2.0, 2.0]",Sep-19,8,4,2,['never']

All were good - the standout was the brisket - it's up there with Stiles Switch and La Barbecue, maybe not quite as good as Franklin or John Mueller (when he's cooking he's top of the class in my opinion), but that's very good company. The pork spareribs were very large - two of them were over half a pound. The turkey and sausage was all good as well - my wife gave the nod to the jalapeño popper sausage over the hatch green chili sausage, so I'm glad that will be on the menu next time we stop in. We had some sides too, and while you don't go to a barbecue restaurant for the sides, the jalapeño slaw was a standout here.

So many great things to try here but I am highly advising you to try the smoked delicious barbacoa that Moreno Barbecue nails on Sunday mornings. Order the night before (Saturday) for a pickup time convenient for you on their website. I recommend starting with 1lb per 2 people but spoil yourself and get a 2lb'er. You won't regret it! The barbacoa is not fatty, delicious, has a gentle smoked flavor, and comes with the required sides for barbacoa tacos such as homemade flour tortillas, chopped white onions, fresh cilantro, and wedges of lime. Also we got a nice red salsa too to top everthing off. You will appreciate the no-waiting-in-any-kind-of-line-on-a-Sunday kind of Sunday because you thought ahead and ordered the night before. Of course you can always walk up too if you prefer but I would hate for you to miss out on a Barbacoa Sunday IMO.¡Cuidado! (watch out), though!

Let me preface with; I've been in the restaurant business my entire life -Born in Boston, grew up in VT; 20 years in SF where I was an Executive Chef and then Seattle, as Pit Master for a bbq concept based on an old local standby. And now? WOW! I'm new to Austin and stumbled upon this place earlier this week. I was craving a couple ribs for a snack, and new to the neighborhood so thought I'd give it a try. To say the customer service is great is an understatement. They're genuine and welcoming, it's like seeing old friends- however, to my disappointment-sold out of ribs. So I walked with 1/2 lb moist brisket, she was sure to add bread, pickles, onion and side of sauce. This is where words start to fail me...um it was delightful, lovely, heavenly, wonderfully the most delicious smoked brisket I've ever had. I've had my fair share- trust me, it's that good. I liked the sauce, a lite sweetness with a little heat- It was so good, I went back the following afternoon, in the pouring rain, needing to try more. The same ridiculously good service, got my rib fix in and another half pound brisket (that stuff could prove addicting) and a half chicken. Sides were beans, slaw and potato salad- which were all really good. You can feel the love thru the attention to seasoning and prep of the sides. Ribs- nice rub - smoked perfectly almost falling off the bone but still a little bite. Brisket- unbelievable you have to try it to understand it. Chicken, nicely done with a light rub and smooth smoke.  I got home and I found a container of sausage that I hadn't ordered. They were busy and I'm sure it was mistake (I'll pay you guys for it next time.) I'm not really a fan of sausage particularly hot links you find at a lot of bbq places. I'm not sure what kind of sausage they were but , they were truly mouthwateringly amazing. Great service, great bbq right here in my neighborhood. That's a fine welcome to Texas in my book.

I visited with two friends, one of whom had recently moved to Austin from the East Coast and not yet had the privilege of enjoying real deal TX BBQ. I sorely regret that this was my companion's introduction to TX BBQ, because this place is a real bummer all around. First off, atmosphere can best be described as corny, dirty, and (to quote our unfortunate commander-in-chief...) SAD. I get that it's got a kind of rustic vibe that may be interpreted by many as ""authentic"", but frankly to me it's kind of embarrassing. Like, if people think a grimy run down shack with sticky tables, flies buzzin' around, and no AC in the middle of summer (the audacity!) represents an authentic Texan experience then I'm not surprised so many out-of-state visitors are scared to leave the city limits of Austin. After the patron drops an inappropriately large sum of cash on their meal, they get to chose between sitting inside the hot, cramped, windowless shack or dining outside on the make shift patio in the blazing hot sun with scenic Lamar traffic whizzing by just feet away. Talk about southern hospitality!Ok, now the food. Sides were unappetizing, the pulled beef sandwich is a glorified sloppy joe, and the sausage sandwich was a greasy seething mess of nauseating pork fat. I will say that the sandwich was absolutely heaping with meat, but the sheer quantity did not distract from the fact that the sausage was of particularly low quality, sort of soggy, and tasted like an extra salty hot dog. I'm pretty well convinced that this place is only surviving as a sort of tourist trap, or perhaps business traveler trap, or maybe a hungover UT fratboy shame trough. A word of warning: if you are an innocent looking for palatable BBQ in a charming atmosphere, save yourself and avoid House Park Bar-B-Q.","Austin, TX",0,24,3,"[18.0, 1.0, 3.0, 2.0, 0.0]",May-16,24,9,12,['never']

This slogan is similar to another Austin barbecue institution. House Park is located in a shopping center and is within a stone's throw of an Austin classic, The Tavern. When I got there at 11 AM, there were a few people eating inside.I ordered a two-meat plate with moist brisket and pork ribs with a half link of sausage. The plate also came with bean, potato salad, and coleslaw. The brisket had two stories. So the long piece on the bottom of a typical brisket is the flat (lean). The top piece that covers half of it is the point (moist). The flat was chewy, and the point was super fatty. They must have cooked it too high and fast. It had a smoke ring, but without, I would have guessed the brisket was done in an oven. There were no flavors, and it was bland. The ribs were slightly better. They were dry, but the rub had a nice spice. You had to work a little to get the meat off of the bone. The sausage is made by the Texas Sausage Company which is the same people who make the sausage for Franklin Barbecue. It is sad if that was the best thing I ate. The sausage was a beef and pork house blend. The peppercorn gave it good kick. The sides were boring but did look homemade. More seasoning please?Bland was the story here. I am not sure how House Park House Park Bar-B-Que is in business with the limited hours. Sure, some places in town are only open for lunch, but their line snakes around the building. A lot of the places I eat at, the smoked meats are cut in front of you. Sometimes when you watch them cut the meat, you know it is not going to be a good experience.

House Park BBQ has been around since 1943, but their years of experience don't translate to the kind of quality BBQ that you need to compete in this town. The beans were underspiced and had a pinto-y off-taste that suggested they could have used more slow cooking. The potato salad was of cafeteria quality; bland, uninspired and lacking in flavor. The brisket had a decent rub, but that didn't save the dry, minimum-smoke-time taste that's so characteristic of pedestrian BBQ. There was nothing intriguing enough about the sausage; it was passable. They've got a decent sauce, though it was a bit on the vinegary side and was too watery to adhere to the BBQ to compensate for the lack of taste. The chopped beef sandwich is the way to go at House Park because it showcases the two decent things they have to offer: the brisket rub and the sauce. Again though, being in Austin you could just drive down to Ruby's and have the best chopped beef sandwich of your life.It's a shame that House Park looks and feels like it should have remarkable 'Q and delivers uninspired BBQ that you would find at Bill Miller.

I was actually on my way to Stubb's because of their Serrano Cheese Spinach side dish (which is outstanding) but I am so glad that I got this brisket instead. Beans, potato salad, onions, pickles, fatty brisket, BBQ sauce, and bread was only $6 - what a deal! It was awesome and full of flavor. A two meat plate would only have been $8 and I think these prices are more than fair for the quality and quantity of meat they serve. I brought  home enough food to have a hearty sandwich and most of the side dishes, so it was at least two complete meals for that price, which is fantastic.

This bbq was smothered in sauce (see pictures), or maybe even drowning. And the sauce was just okay. I ordered the brisket and the chicken and found them just to be okay, the sauce was overpowering and tangy. The brisket, despite the bath it was taking, I found to be kind of dry. As we were finishing up, a group of bachelor party goers, very clearly drunk, rolled in and raved about how much they loved the brisket. My friend decided maybe everyone who wrote a yelp review was drunk and that's why they thought the food was good? it was a fair assessment, since we were next to a group of drunken bros and it's open until 4 am.I was saddened that this was so highly rated on Yelp and we made this our back up to La Barbecue.

This is some of the absolute worst BBQ I have ever had in my entire life. Does anyone taste the food before adding it to the menu? The mac and cheese, no flavor whatsoever. N-O-N-E! How does that even happen? Coleslaw, chunky pieces of slaw that were way too big and also completely tasteless. The sausage, not that great. Just meh.The pulled pork, something was seriously off with it. It tasted a little sour and rancid. You know how pork gets when it's going off? It has that way too porkish kind of taste? Yep, I'll pay for that later in my review. We also tried the Mexican deviled eggs and they were super thick and flavorless as well. Queso was decent. I liked the atmosphere and our server was absolutely wonderful. That's the only positive I have about my experience. We weren't even completely out of the parking lot when my stomach started to turn. Couldn't even make it home without a bathroom emergency stop.  Some people must like it because there were a lot of people there during lunch time.

It's sliced very thick and had a nice chew and subtle sweetness. It goes really well with their honey spread - make sure to eat it warm. The potato salad has a lot of celery in it - not for everyone but I was into it. Coleslaw was also good. The vegetables are chopped rather than shredded, and the taste was solid.We ordered beef ribs, pork ribs, sausage, and lean brisket. It came all piled up on a single large plate (as you can see in my picture), which made it hard to get at the stuff underneath. Would've been nice to serve it on 2 plates. Both types of ribs weren't very seasoned or flavorful, just a general meat and oil taste. Also, the meat wasn't tender and required a lot of effort to eat, and the beef especially had a lot of cartilage and fat. The sausage was pretty standard, nothing bad but nothing special. Lastly, the lean brisket was quite dry and tough. It was cut thinly and didn't have much taste.

And because the restaurant can occasionally draw a crowd, you can make reservations online.Food?  Above average.  But in Austin's competitive BBQ field these days, above average no longer suffices. Both of us really liked the pork ribs, which were perfectly cooked and had a good flavor.  I wasn't as much of a fan of the shredded beef which most would call chopped beef.  It might have been my odd tastes, but I could've sworn I tasted a hint of pickle to the beef.  The fries were good -- as in hot and crispy.  The mac and cheese, which was an upcharge, was pretty standard food service stuff and not worth the money.  Their homemade bread is worth every penny, especially with the honey butter at the table.  They brought out two different sauces, one for the beef and one for the pork.  Truthfully, I was unable to discern much difference and didn't find either particularly inspiring.Long story short -- if you're in the situation that I was in -- wanting ribs and a sit down dinner, this is a great option.  Otherwise, it's just another place to satisfy a BBQ craving in a city full of stellar BBQ options.","Austin, TX",7,3,0,[],Mar-18,1,0,0,['never']

Both ribs are juice the pork are more fall off the bone but the beef ribs are killer, absolutely love them. The pork sauce is my favorite it goes well with everything even the potato salad. To finish off your meal if your looking for a great desert try the homemade banana pudding and for a delicious heartier one my all time fave to share is the bread pudding, talk about delicious!

I really don't blame the server, who was friendly, just slow and seemingly poorly trained. I blame the management for not making sure wait staff knows what they are doing, and more importantly for (apparently) not being on the floor to check on their customers. Our server took forever and forgot multiple items. Tables around us were also sitting and waiting. If you're wondering about the food, it's below average barbecue and sides. Unimpressive brisket and sausage, with forgettable cole slaw and ok beans. In a town with great barbecue I don't know why you'd come to County Line, except to maybe take in a great view. If you don't pay extra for the homemade bread (worth it! says the menu) then you get bread that would never be served by another restaurant. I took a photo of the sign by the drive.

We went to the Highway 71 location. The first time we went in a young man helped us and was great. He explained the menu, asked us if we had any questions and made sure we were taken care of. Awesome job. We had seen him 3 other times since then and he always gave us exceptional service and even remembered who we were. Wish I got his name because he was awesome. That brings us to our last visit. I received another free small nacho coupon for my birthday which I thought was awesome since they were so good the last time we had them. We went to this location on Thursday, March 5, 2020. When we walked in there were 3 employees working, the cashier and the cooks and about 4 other patrons. We were greeted by a female cashier. She asked for our order, we told her we were going to be getting the small nachos and presented the coupon. Due to food allergies we asked for the cheese and brisket only. The cashier looked visibly annoyed, proceeded to tell us we would be getting a kids nacho instead because it only comes with cheese and meat and would be too much for her to have to remove the items we did not want if she placed the order as a normal adult meal. My wife told her we would be sharing them and were not told before we would have to get a kid's nacho due to what we were ordering. She didn't tell us anything and put the kid's order in. My wife then noticed they were putting the cheese on the chips and asked if they could put the cheese on the side since it was a to-go order and she tells us they already made it. We told her that the last couple of times we have ordered that the young man that helped us, on more than one occasion, said the cheese is always put on the side for to go orders. She again was visibly annoyed, yelled to her cooks that ""they want the cheese on the side"" and ""I'm not going to eat that"" when they asked if she wanted them since they were not able to sell them. We sat and waited for our order. She bags it and throws it at our table causing the bag to almost fall and she has to catch it before it does. We got home and opened our food to see chips, about a tablespoon of cheese and a dollop of brisket. Not happy at all.

The sausage is a finer grind, not coarse, but amazingly juicy without making it feel like a oily bomb.  I wimped out and went for the regular but it still has a nice kick.  I think another reviewer had a similar comment.  Both times I've gone I've loved the brisket and sausage and so haven't felt the need to challenge the lines at La Barbecue, Franklin, etc.6.  Finally - the brisket.  Fatty and lean and all are excellent with the expected spicy bark.  Like most fans I've had my share of Franklin, La Barbecue, Micklethwait's, and Browns (over on SoLa) and have also regularly been to Freedmans and Terry Blacks.  Since discovering Twelve bones I haven't gone back to the more established places.  Next on my list will be the burnt ends (a Kansas City thing, and I've only had the Jack Stack version, which was not really that memorable).  The minuses:1.  So new, still some minor kinks.  Forgot the sauce in my takeout (which wasn't a big deal to me since the meats were so gosh darn good.  No Big Red the second morning I visited it (you almost HAVE to have it in any BBQ place.  2.  The pickles might use a little more vinegar, but maybe I'm just used to the bottled variety.  These pickles are fully home-made.In all, I really hope Twelve Bones makes it.  That location had some good places but nothing could ever stick around - Lulus was a great trailer but didn't seem to generate traffic as a brick and mortar.","Austin, TX",92,12,2,"[10.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 2.0]",Aug-11,18,1,5,['never']

I make it a point to visit as many BBQ as I can as often as I can. With so many choices here in this amazing town, it's tough to pick favorites, but Twelve Bones is a stand-out to me.I now visit this truck on a weekly basis, even though I work near the Arboretum and have to brave Mopac to get there.Pitmaster Marco Oglesby is a master at his craft. He's a genuine and warm person with an intense love for what he does, which translates into amazing barbecue.Too often, pitmasters will over-season the food, dishonoring the meat. Marco never does this. His rubs accentuate the natural flavors without overpowering them. This matters.The baby back ribs are the best in town. The spare ribs are never tough or chewy, because they aren't rushed through the smoking process.I don't like turkey. Even on Thanksgiving, I barely eat any. Yet, I order turkey every time I visit Twelve Bones, because it is incredibly delicious. I can't believe I'm even typing this right now, because turkey is awful, but I love it here.The burnt ends are also amazing and again, not over-seasoned. There are plenty of places in town you can go to to find salty, over-peppered meat, but Twelve Bones is not one of them.I should also mention the sides. The coleslaw is great, more flavorful than I had expected. The team is always experimenting with new sides, keeping things fresh.So if you're interested in BBQ that is made with great care, full of flavor, and never rushed, Twelve Bones is the place to go. And Twelve Bones is still new enough that the lines aren't too long, so go now before this place gets too famous.","Austin, TX",69,4,0,"[2.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]",May-14,6,3,0,['never']

Also, for some reason they store the meat wrapped directly in plastic, which seals in more water moisture than is probably good. Put that pink paper to work, man!My rating is entirely based on the seasoning, as I am very impressed with the texture and internal flavor of the meat. The escabeche was delightful, and the mac & cheese was lovely. Still, you don't go to a BBQ joint in Austin for the sides, and the flavor was off.

But I'm going to enjoy some ""Damn Good BBQ"" too. Texas makes you salivate for good smoked meats. In my search and asking locals a couple recommendations keep repeating. ""You got to try Kerlin BBQ"". You won't wait an hour and a half and you get some of the best damn BBQ in Austin. Tucked behind the Shell Gas station on E Cesar Chavez St (East of the 35), is a trailer, picnic tables and the smell of BBQ smoke.Kerlin quickly established itself as a serious player 6 yrs ago and have the accolades to prove it. Arizona transplants, Bill and Amelis Kerlin, started as backyard enthusiasts before hitting the competition scene and taking home a grand prize on there first outing. They embrace Central TX tradition with a standard post-oak wood smoke and then amp it up with quality Prime Angus beef. They also have some great Pork Belly Burnt Ends with really great flavor. I decided to build myself my own platter to sample some of the tasty things on the menu. One of those is a kolache, typically a Czech / Hungarian pastry. In Texas this is a staple in some barbecue joints. I've never had it before, but being part Czech I wasn't about to skip the opportunity. Basically a bread pocket filled with meat and plenty of flavor. I chose the sausage, cheddar cheese and jalapenos. All I can say is I can't wait to try the other meats.

I just love that you can visit these town in Texas and have world class BBQ. When they opened it was extra special treat to see Wayne Mueller himself. We were a bit starstruck. The smoke stained walls just add to the experience as you walk in. With so many options we had to limit our order. So we selected a beef rib and some ribs. Thankfully when we placed our order we were given a sample of their brisket which was very good. We have learned to love the beef ribs and the beef rib here was fantastic. One of the best that we had in Texas. Great bark, smoky flavor and velvety smooth. You could cut it with a plastic fork. Just outstanding! The pork ribs were good. Not great but good.

It had been quite a few years since I've been here, but you can't come through Taylor without stopping for some good Texas BBQ at Louie Mueller's!!! It's been here for years and is now in the capable hands of his son Wayne Mueller. We stopped in and apparently they had only been open for a couple of days after being closed like so many other places due the Covid situation that continues to haunt us all. We were met at the counter by a very nice assistant and she took our order. We started off asking for one pound of moist and lean brisket. I also got one of their huge beef ribs! We asked for half a rack of pork ribs because that's what my wife is all about, but they were out!!! She them asked about some sliced turkey and they were out of that too!! The counter assistant then offered up some pulled pork which my wife loves too which they had, so we got that and some smoked sausage. We got our drinks and sat down at table where there were windows in the section over from the kitchen. They got our order ready and I picked it up from the counter. The brisket was way better than I remember the last time!!! The beef rib was really good and tender and pulled off the bone!! My wife had new try some of the pulled pork. I was REALLY impressed with their pulled pork!!! It had to be some of the best I've ever tried here in Texas! The sausage was really good too. I loved the ambience and the friendliness of the staff. They did take time to explain that they were not really back up to speed yet do to just re-opening and just not having a lot of customers yet! I can accept that. The place has been there a long time and had a lot of old antique stuff on display that had been used there at one time or another. An old cash register and an old sausage press being a couple of the items. It was a really good experience even without the pork ribs and Turkey and well be back!!!

Central Texas BBQ is world-renowned, and this establishment is always mentioned in the upper echelons. Curious to give it a try.The beef brisket & pork ribs are rather hard for me to describe, imagine the most buttery pot roast you have ever eaten but smoked. Dang, right sinful! I had my heart on the sausage link & pulled pork sandwich but unfortunately after waiting in line for 20 minutes they were all sold out...it was a busy morning for them.  So we both settled on what they had left. When you order a staff member asks how many in your party, then the meat cutter walks up with many little chunks of brisket/meat for you to sample and then takes your order. We ordered 1/2 lb of beef brisket, 1/2 lb of pork ribs and beef brisket sandwich. There's not a whole lot of sides to choose from. Potato salad, cole slaw and pinto beans. I didn't love their beans or their potato salad... fairly basic and not a lot of flavour. Final rating... A-Ok!We are newly Austin transplants and still pretty much  learning all kinds of Texas BBQ. Here's what I've learned about Louie Mueller BBQ in Taylor; their motto is 9 parts pepper and 1 part salt, so it has a bite. Moist, tender, and good smokey flavour... it wasn't heavy nor overwhelming. They use oak wood for smoke to achieved that.Forewarned, if you don't like pepper rub chances are you won't like this. Good smoked BBQ comes with a price tag as well, so keep that in mind folks.Everyone was nice and helpful. Parking is plentiful around the establishment, and they have a large sized indoor main dining room with an attached sunroom type eating area with a covered patio. I loved the atmosphere. I had my heart set at visiting Franklin's BBQ in downtown Austin but there's always a multi-hour wait, and since I heard Aaron Franklin learned to cook from Louie Mueller, why not just visit the best.  A plus...only had to wait about 20 minutes.  ""Barbecue is not a matter of chance; but a matter of choice.""--unknown","Round Rock, TX",3,157,189,"[54.0, 79.0, 15.0, 6.0, 3.0]",Aug-11,114,55,72,"['Elite 2021', '’20', '’19']"

As my wife and I have smoked a number of briskets ourselves in Hawaii and her family in and from Texas have smoked meats for years, I wanted to see what this place had to offer.Unfortunately, we were both very disappointed by the taste, which was just ok but also that it was served at room temperature and basically not hot which is how I like my food served.We ordered 1/2 lbs of brisket, 2 sausage links, one spare rib just to try, one serving each of coke slaw and potato salad, and two drinks, ice tea and a bottle is soda. It came with a small dish of Some sort of broth. Cost $37.The brisket as I said was basically served cold as was the sausage links. Brisket tasted just ok and the sausage was over cooked and dry as well as cold. The spare rib was warmer as it was taken out of the smoke box, but not hot. Ok flavor. Worst were the sides.  Both were both awful. Cole slaw tastes like pepper & mayo and unpalatable. Potato salad was heavy mustard & pepper and no better. Think we ate 1/3 of it just kept trying to see if it got better. It didn't.  Didn't know what the side broth was or what it was for. Never got an explanation or instruction. Assumed it was a dipping sauce. It didn't help the meat as there was little flavor in it and wasn't hot.Their bbq sauces were decent. Wife liked the Jalapeño one and I liked sweet one. Only saving grace.  That and the ambiance was very unique.In the end, We didn't finish the meats and tossed most of the side dishes we didn't finish. We will not be coming back here ever again.

If you aren't, this is some awesome meat. In fact, bring a cooler as you are going to have some left over. Really, you should think about sharing this with someone before arriving.The challenge is that this place has been so good for so long that the service kind of suffers. I felt like I was in the Soup episode of Seinfeld. They will bite on your head if you do anything out of order or act in any way like a rube. Just stay there in line and don't do anything until told. The service is definitely the type you get from a place that is world class and doesn't really give a rip if you never return. In fact I won't.Also, the sides are to pass on.

We also ordered two sides, and two drinks, for a grand total of $75 dollars !!! Not worth it. I asked for bbq sauce as the brisket needed some help, they brought me a container of basting sauce (very watery). We were so disappointed, especially after being in the Top Five of the Top Fifty for the Texas Monthly Magazine. We will NEVER return. A few days later I took my son in law to the Rudy's in Round Rock (all Rudy's are not the same), and he was blown away with their ""Real Texas BBQ"". Why 2 Stars ?? Delicious sausage links. That's all I've got to say about that.","Liberty Hill, TX",0,8,1,"[7.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]",Oct-19,0,0,0,['never']

We're visiting ATX, and we heard positively wonderful things about this establishment. It came highly recommended, so we thought we would patronize black owned businesses during our stay in Austin. We perused the menu, decided to sample a few things like the Brisket Frito Pie and a few other things to get a taste, and we placed an online order. Nothing indicated the business wasn't open on July 15, 2020. The order went through perfectly fine, and we were even given a pickup location. We left our rental home and headed to the address given on the order. When we arrived, J. Leonardi was closed. We didn't see anyone around. Nothing was listed on the Facebook page or website indicating an early closure.  In fact, their website, Google, and even Facebook all said they would be open until 6 PM but online orders had to be received by 3:00 PM. We sent  in our order before the time. When we called the phone number while parked in front of a closed business, we were met with a prerecorded message stating they were at another location nearby. The message said 1149 1/2 Airport something which was different from the address given on the website. We went to that address, and there was another business there but not this one. When we drove back to the original location, we were told J. Leonardi was closed by another gentleman/business owner sitting down. I don't know if there was a failure to communicate, or if something unexpected happen, but we were less than impressed. We were left quite bemused because we were able to place an order, and no one called to say, ""We're closed or not accepting orders."" I guess our money was just going to be tied up or eventually refunded if they had ever realized it. Maybe not.I reached out via Facebook Messenger at 4:39 the same day, and it's now just past 48 hours. I haven't received a response. One thing I look for and actively seek is quality, A1 customer service and clear, concise communication. As a precautionary measure, the card used was canceled. My mom wasn't sure what was going on, but she felt like it was some funny business, and considering we didn't get an order but the transaction tried to clear yesterday or today like everything went through, I certainly understand how and why she feels that way.I really didn't want to leave a review like this because it's never my intent to leave bad reviews or hurt anyone's livelihood, but with the lack of response and no explanation regarding the other day or even an attempt to make amends, it was simply a must. I hope that this will help you improve and communicate with paying customers the next go round. I can honestly say I won't even try to place another order with your establishment because this experience has soured me and completely put me off.","Alexandria, LA",0,13,14,"[9.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 4.0]",Jun-19,6,0,0,['never']

The possibility of rating a 4.5 would have had my fingers typing sooner. Since that's not an option, flashbacks to elementary math had me round up to five. Additionally, I had told my cousin that if I lived in the Austin area, I'd be hesitant to write a review for fear of a lengthy line the next time I wanted some BBQ.We found a different barbecue spot with great ratings, thanks to Yelpers. We stood in line with the masses although there was no guarantee we'd be served. As an out-of-towner, I was quite intrigued by the whole process. As a person who doesn't enjoy waiting in a line that's not moving much and with no guarantee that I'll get what I'm waiting for, the curiosity waned and I went back to reliable Yelp for nearby alternatives. Up pops J. Leonardi stationed a couple blocks away! I quietly shared the info with my cousin and we left the line with dozens of customers behind us smiling at our departure. This food trailer presented as clean, organized, and with a nice variety to choose from. There was a very short line, woo-hoo, and once our two-meat meals were ordered, he began preparing the assembly line of tickets placed above his head. The gentleman who was taking orders now worked efficiently, with disposable gloves on, to reduce the number of tickets overhead. I observed that he swapped gloves several times as we waited for our order to be filled. I don't know if that's a requirement for Austin food trailers, but high five for that! Order filled, we headed back to our vehicle with carry out bag in hand. Driving past our initial destination, the line was considerably shorter, just outside of the door, but we had no regrets about leaving and being able to get exactly what we wanted. I had the baby back ribs and brisket with jalapeno cream corn and smoked cabbage. My cousin had grilled chicken and brisket with potato salad and smoked cabbage. All was melt in your mouth delicious! The rub used on the meats is incomparable. The seasoning for the sides had just the right amount of whatever to be flavorful without overpowering. I considered a four-star rating because the majority of my brisket slices were half fat and half meat. I've had brisket at restaurants and was served lean cuts. The pics on Yelp show no fat on the brisket. Not sure what happened with my order. However, with a small pile of fat building, I continued to eat and was a very happy girl! When in Austin, I will gladly return to J. Leonardi's Barbeque to satisfy my BBQ fix with a polite request that they trim the fat on my brisket.

I had the unfortunate experience of eating here last week, (11-2-17) While the atmosphere seemed pleasant, the cashier was pretty abrupt with me and seemed like I was bothering them. I ordered Brisket and sausage. While the sausage had a semi decent flavor, it was obvious it had been sitting for quit a while as it had the texture of a slim jim. Brisket had a small smoke ring but was super dry. So I had to sop it all up with bbq sauce. Fortunately that had a good enough flavor to cover up the sadness i was consuming. And if the culinary experience wasn't trough enough, instead of smelling the loveliness of smokey meats, all I could smell was some kind of cleaner that my nose told me was the same scent of a urinal cake. Not my favorite scent.All in all, I guess for a quick and cheap bite, its acceptable but unfortunatley this place is as drab as most of the reviews I've read.3-10-18Thanks jeff for your mediocre response.

We'd pick up chopped beef sandwiches and take them down to Town Lake at a time you could still drive there in 12 minutes instead of 30+. The Pit also became part of our holiday tradition - we'd take our own turkey and have the Duff family smoke it and slice it - so delicious, we vowed never to cook our own again. After 40 years in the business, the Duff's son wanted to retire and the Pit changed management. Fortunately the new manager is an Austinite - in fact, in the 70s he would ride his bike to the Pit to buy (you guessed it) chopped beef sandwiches. I taste change - the meat seems a bit blander, as does the potato salad. But the sauce and cole slaw are still great. These are easy fixes which I hope Orlando will make. That's why I give this review a 3 instead of a 2. I'm thankful he's trying to save an Austin institution too often overlooked by people who can't see past the new restaurants to those who have fed locals for a long, long time. The Pit can be a 4/5 again - I look forward to supporting it as it gets there. (And it would help significantly if you all would also bring back the smoke-your-own-meat option!)Thanks for caring about 'old' Austin - all best.","Austin, TX",0,6,0,"[5.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",Apr-17,0,1,0,['never']

I had not been to The Pit in a long time, so I decided to go get some chopped barbecue sandwiches. Once I got there, everything smelled so good that instead I ordered 3/4 lb of brisket, 3/4 lb of ribs and 1/2 lb of the chopped beef. Based on the prices I saw on the website this morning, I thought it would be about 25.00 with tax. They were busy so I didn't stop to question it when what was charged on my card was $32.66 - Later I called and the guy who answered said their prices increased on the ribs and brisket some time ago from $12.49 to $15.49/lb. That is quite a hike! I told him about the website prices and he said, ""yeah that is old"". I told him they needed to update the website - that is false advertising and under the law you have to sell at advertised prices. He said it wasn't his problem. WON'T BE BACK.Jeff D.'s comment on your review:Douglas, I'm terribly sorry to hear you are upset about this. While the prices on the website are out of date, all prices in the restaurant are current -- I apologize if this caused some confusion. Web sites can be difficult and expensive to maintain, especially for small family businesses such as ours -- I hope you can understand that. Still, I'd like to learn a bit more about your visit -- which day did you stop in? Hope to hear back, Jeff Duff, Owner One week agoMy visit was on Monday, November 2nd at approx. 11:45 AM. I understand that websites are expensive to maintain, especially for a small business, but if you are not going to keep it current, better to get rid of it. Advertising one price on the website and not honoring it at your place of business is misleading and brings customers into your restaurant under false pretenses. This is illegal. Advertised prices must be honored. That the person I spoke with took no interest in the validity of my complaint is not satisfactory. I would like to know what you think is a fair resolution to this issue.One hour agoDouglas, I appreciate you taking the time to get back to me and again apologize for any confusion caused by the website and for the handling of the situation on site. Again, thank you for the feedback.BestJeff Duff, OwnerOne hour agoMr. Duff - I am glad that you are appreciative, but that is not enough to make me want to return. You are sorry. Okay. And? This is where a business owner interested in retaining a customer and ensuring he doesn't lose even more customers because this customer is dissatisfied, says - ""We will get the information on the website corrected immediately"", ""We will take down the website since it is misleading and is too expensive to update"" or ""I would like to make this right with you"".

Anything you get there is packed with flavor and their store operations during COVID-19 are very safe and they take precautions very seriously. All sides are prepackaged including the onions, pickles, and breads. Our family eats a lot, and they were generous to give us a whole new loaf! For meats I recommend the MOIST brisket over the lean. It's so tender, juicy, and flavorful. Lean is also good but not as flavor packed, definitely need to use some extra bbq sauce for that. The sausage is so tasty and a personal favorite. For a family of 4 I recommend choosing 3 meats off the menu, with some extra sides. Half a pound isn't as much as you think! My favorite sides are the cream corn and beans! The corn is super sweet and creamy, and beans are packed with flavor. I thought the potato salad was just like any others you could find at your local grocery store, so you might want to take a pass on that. For dessert, the banana pudding was delicious, but a bit on the pricier end for a small cup. I liked the taste except the vanilla wafers were slightly old. However, I'm a big fan of banana pudding and could not pass up the chance. It's served with a generous amount of whipped cream.  Never had a bad meal at Rudy's, and I fully recommend any Texan looking for bbq to stop by!

Presentation - Store is always stocked with drinks sides and refreshments you can grab as you go through the line. 2. Friendliness- Rudy's staff is Super Friendly. Big Super Welcome if you're a First Timer and they Offer you samples of their cuts. 3. Rudy's offers discounts to Military Vets and First Responders. 4. Rudy's offers several Meat selections. Pork Ribs, Brisket (Regular, Moist and Lean), Chicken, Smoked Turkey and Sausages. The cuts are always fresh, always full of flavor. For me the Saint Louis Pork Ribs and the brisket sometimes have a bit too much rub, making them a little salty. 5. Cleanliness - Now BBQ is a""Hands On"" meal. Knife and a Fork, won't get you too far. You got to grab it with yo hands, place yo elbows on the table and dig in. Rudy's has an automatic hand washing machine for your convenience. The staff is always clearing tables, wiping them down and restocking items. Paper towels and BBQ sare in the table and some stores.

It is not salty either and overall is well balanced. I would get this again.Cream Corn - this is my favorite place to get cream corn. Creamy, nice texture, delicious!

This time, it is Brotherton's Black Iron BBQ. Eschewing my normal ritual of sampling all the main meats (forgive me, oh BBQ gods), I decided to try their famous sandwiches instead. Of all the great options, we went with the Brisket Banh Mi and Turkey Pesto. Both sandwiches come in a hefty serving, not skimping on either meat or bread. The meats in both were also delicious and smoked to perfection. Despite my love for brisket, I felt the smoked turkey Brotherton's has here is probably some of the best I've ever hard, and slightly outdid the Brisket Banh Mi. Both were enough to fill The Wife and I up and it is refreshing to see a BBQ place step out on a ledge and try something new.  So, we will definitely be back to Brotherton's, to either try more of their unique sandwich creations or just a sampling from the Holy Trinity.","Fort Worth, TX",1354,1267,21,"[306.0, 427.0, 250.0, 189.0, 95.0]",Aug-09,5355,2067,3029,"['Elite 2021', '’20', '’19', '’18', '’17', '’16', '’15', '’14', '’13', '’12', '\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 more year as an Elite\n\n']"

Artisan BBQ.  Craft BBQ.  Whatever you want to call it, the Austin area has been getting more and more places for better BBQ.  And now, Pflugerville has Brotherton's for an upscale BBQ option.  I'd been meaning to try them and when a friend suggested lunch, I jumped at the opportunity to give them a try. First of all, I appreciated the spacious restaurant area.  Even with the lunch rush, there was plenty of room to find a table.  And the line moved efficiently. (I think the idea of serving the meat plates from the line and taking sandwich orders to be brought out is a stroke of genius.)Let's talk about the food. My brisket was slightly above average.  There was a beautiful bark, the fat was rendered, and a nice smoke ring.  Unfortunately, there wasn't a strong hint of smoke or seasoning, especially in comparison to the appearance. The ribs were the meat highlight for sure.  The ribs were cooked to the right temperature and the seasoning was a welcome combination of sweetness with a hint of spice. The green chili mac and cheese tasted exactly like macaroni noodles served with queso.  The sauce was also a welcome accompaniment to the meats.  However, the spicy bbq sauce available at the condiment table was a real disappointment. Both my friend and I are native Texans and very used to spicy food.  However, this spicy sauce was overwhelmingly hot to the point of harshness which took away from any other flavor.  Brotherton's is pretty good BBQ if you're looking for a bite in Pflugerville.  But there are even better options around the Austin area.","Austin, TX",119,63,149,"[15.0, 23.0, 22.0, 3.0, 0.0]",Oct-15,50,9,24,['Elite 2019']

Had a 4 hour layover so I decided to eat here at 3:30 so I can take my time eating just before  boarding at 4:30. Line was really long and I heard of these guys before so I was looking forward to what they have to offer.So I ended up getting the 3 Meat Platter($18.99) so I can sample as many meats as I can. Comes with potato salad, coleslaw, and beans. Your choices of meat are brisket, sausage, pulled pork, chopped beef, and turkey. I was disappointed that the ribs werent one of the choices. I even asked if i could at least order one rib on the side so I can try it but the cashier said you cant do that unless your order both as plates. So what I got was pulled pork, chopped brisket, and sliced brisket. They put a couple drops of bbq sauce on there so I had to go get some more. They have them ready to go in little cups. Another disappointment is that the only choice you have is their original bbq sauce. From what I noticed you can purchase bottles of their bbq sauce in either original or spicy. So why not have both available? Btw, their sauce is vinegar based so if you are not into that then be fore warned. It's alright with me but not my first choice.As for the taste it was decent. You can taste the smokiness in every bite. I gotta admit though, the pulled pork tasted just like the brisket. A little bit of dryness was evident too. So I poured several cups of bbq sauce to get some flavor on there. The sides were just ok as well. Nothing really stood out. The Texas toast they give you is just your basic plain toast. I guess I got spoiled by Raising Canes because the Texas toast they give you is buttered AND toasted.Service was ok. You order at the counter, they give you your receipt with your number that they call for you to pick up. I waited about 10 minutes. Not too bad because the line was pretty long to begin with.In closing, im assuming that the brick and mortar establishments are probably much better. Was thinking I was gonna have leftovers but the meats were just right to fill me up. So if you are really hungry, the two meat platter will not be enough for you. I would also like to mention that the tables you can sit at has electrical outlets so that you can charge your electronic devices. Next time I need to go to one of their restaurant locations.Yelp 2019 Review #23764 overall","San Tan Valley, AZ",0,7,1,"[3.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 4.0]",Jan-19,6,1,0,['never']

The food was pretty good, especially for airport food. The price was an airport price, and the service was really disjointed. Hence three stars, right down the middle. Here's the good and the bad.So the food was pretty good. For some reason I was not feeling brisket or other traditional barbecue, so I was pleased to see that a smoked turkey sandwich was an option. The sandwich was huge with thick slabs of turkey on a giant brioche bun. I ate only half of it. But it was good. The potato salad that came with it was also good but a bit on the spicy side for me. My friend got the brisket and seemed to enjoy it.The ordering process here is really the thing that drew most of my negative energy. It's very confusing. It's not very well explained. You have to kind of walk down the side of the counter to where there are two registers with people taking orders. Then when you order you have to make like 9,000 choices. I ordered a turkey sandwich man. I had to then choose sauce or no sauce, drink or no drink, which side, for here or to go, etc etc. It became really clear to me why the line does not move quickly here. Then after I ordered my soda, the guy who took my order left his station, ran behind the counter, served my soda and handed it to me. So inefficient! So once you order, someone else fills your order. They call your number and you go get your food. This was not efficient, you couldn't hear.

Most of the food seemed to be cooked from the night before outside of the obvious eggs and biscuits, but they had a huge vat of cold sausages they were warming up. With that seen, I had expected not the finest dining experience, but to be honest, this was a quick eat and go, so I was fine with it. The price point was great, $8.99 for a platter which could fill anyone up quite honestly. When it comes to the flavor, lets just say the food never made it to ""flavor town"", most items were quite bland, but the sausage had a decent taste to it. As for the restaurant itself, its a pretty decent size depending on which one you visit, the one I had visited had many booths to occupy with a decent bar. On a side note about the bar, it looks like they have plenty of local wine and beer to choose from, which is a plus for those looking for alcohol prior to boarding.

I ordered a double cheeseburger, fries and a drink ($10 + change). The portion size was good - met my expectations.As for the taste buds, the meal was rather...basic. Not bad, but nothing special either. It satisfied my hunger but missed an opportunity to be amazing. It kinda reminded me of decent cafeteria type food.

Folks, I'm referring to none other than the Marty. If you haven't had one yet, I suggest you get over to Fitties ASAP and order yourself one (or two or three). You might only be able to eat one since they're so large, but there's nothing wrong with hoarding more for later.My affinity for the Marty started 5 years ago, when my husband brought home one that a coworker had gifted him. I'm pretty sure that my inner fat kid died and went to heaven when I took my first bite. Now every time I go near Bastrop, I stop at Fitties. This past Wednesday, I stopped around lunch time, only to find out that they stopped making breakfast tacos at 11:00am. I didn't realize it until then, but all of my past trips have been in the morning, so it never even crossed my mind that they'd stop serving tacos! I gave Gary (the owner) so much grief, but he took it like a champ. I ended up ordering the Lucy, which is a lean brisket sandwich with a side (I chose potato salad) and drink. All for under $7 - what?!? So reasonably priced. Pro tip: they require a minimum of $15 for credit card charges, so remember to bring some cash. Gary threw in peach cobbler because he felt so bad, which was super nice of him. Everything was delicious! The meat was tender, the potato salad was fresh, and the cobbler was warm. I also love their BBQ sauce, which is more savory than sweet. And of course, the customer service is spectacular - Gary is a hoot!Bottom line: Fitties ain't fancy but they sure do dish out some darn good food!","Round Rock, TX",164,12,14,"[11.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]",Jul-15,3,0,0,['never']

It's a surprisingly large space for a strip mall, with barred, zig-zag line control at the BBQ counter, 2 self-serve drink & garnish stations, tons of tables, a gift & to-go meat market shop up front, and parking & entrances on both the south and east sides. We gave them a try for walk-up take-out the other night and really enjoyed our meal, even with a couple of hiccups on the service. We dropped in on a whim at dinner time, realizing Southside was now open, having just been across the lot at the Skecher store picking up the ever more gigantic shoes my now 13 year-old son apparently requires every 4 months. :-/I wanted a savory assortment to test, so we stepped up to the counter and began rattling off about 7 things. As a native Texan, I've been trained from an early age to have my order ready when reaching my turn with the meat cutter, so as to not inconvenience the large line behind me or annoy the knife-wielding professional before me. Well, this particular gentleman seemed new to the task, as he asked me to slow down and repeat myself so he could write up the ticket on a pad of order paper, and he needed some assistance from the other team member next to him to find the menu items I'd requested. He also missed that this was a to-go order, so some repackaging was needed at the end. No biggie - I'm sure this will get better with time as the new team finds their groove.We ordered the following items, plus fountain drinks:1 Sausage Slammer ($4), a sausage enrobed, cheddar-stuffed jalapeño, wrapped in bacon & smoked to perfection.This was an easy-to-split appetizer for 2, providing about 3 bites for each person. I love jalapeño poppers, bacon, and sausage, so this one was a no-brainer. Tasty if a little dry overall, but that's preferable to flabby bacon. 1 lb Original Beef Sausage ($14)Not bad, not bad. We've always preferred Meyer's sausage to Southside's when we are stopping for BBQ in Elgin over the years, but this long, snappy link with a natural pork casing and a bit of black pepper bite was a-okay. I just finished off the last of the leftovers on that one and I enjoyed every bite even after a few days in the fridge and a microwave reheat.1/2 lb USDA Prime Brisket ($10.5), no menu option of distinction for moist, lean, or house-choice.When I made my order, I'd asked for ""Moist Brisket"" and there was no correction back to me to let me know that they don't do that (apparently). It was a bummer to unwrap this meat at home 20 minutes later & see the total absence of juice or fat - this was definitely a too-lean-for-me cut. I wouldn't order this brisket again.1 Chopped Brisket Baked Potato ($10), entrée-size with chopped brisket and all the fixins.OMG, I am a sucker for every possible preparation of the humble spud, and I've been known to order hundreds of Chopped Bakers (with smoked chicken) over the years from Smokey Mo's. The Southside version is huge, like one of those Jason's Deli full-sized baked Russets, only covered in lightly sauced chopped brisket like you'd get on a sandwich, plus cheese, butter, green onion tops, and sour cream. Yes, this may hasten my death date, but - worth it!1 Ranch Hand ($9), layered bowl of cut-to-order brisket, beans, cheese, & diced white onions served w/ Fritos on the side.Imagine the most decadent Frito pie you ever had. The onion level was a bit much for us, but they were easy to push to the side. Delicious!I was disappointed to find that no bread was included in our bag (not sure if we needed to request it or what), so we had to make do with our hippie 8 grain wheat bread at home to make our sausage wraps and next-day brisket sandwiches. I was also bummed that pickle offerings are limited to ridged sour hamburger dill slices - Pokejo's has spoiled me with their superior fermented offerings.The pluses at Southside - Arbor Walk that will likely keep me coming back:- easy online pre-ordering for pick-up- excellent bowls for $10 that could make 2 meals for me (dinner tonight, lunch tomorrow)- close to the Domain area where I live & workCheck out the menu & daily specials online:Menu southsidemarket.com/arbo…Online Order: toasttab.com/southside-m…Specials: southsidemarket.com/aust…Holiday meals (including smoked turkey, ham, or pork loin, with sausage dressing as a side option): southsidemarket.com/holi…Protip: Save 10% on the first online (shipped) order by subscribing to their email list.

Food: Southside Plate is sausage and brisket for $14, and comes with two sides. The sausage is definitely the star here. Flavor is amazing, and the sausage meat is almost tender as you chew through the skin, which has a nice snap without it being too chewy. Brisket was alright, tender and slightly smoky. Pork ribs are pretty good. Hard pass on the baby back - the two on our plate was overly dry, and lacking flavor other than the smoke it was cooked in. Mac and cheese is as you'd expect - creamy and cheesy. Potato salad is good, as are the coleslaw and beans. Service: As most BBQ locations, you walk up and line up. We've not been to the Bastrop location, so we can't compare the two, but we wonder if the ordering system is similar. There's loads of people behind the counter, but it's not cohesive. There's an order taker, who may or may not be cutting up and prepping the meat on your plate. They shout out your sides to the folks at the back, and they bring forward the sides to add to the plate. Which makes its way down to the register, where they seem a bit confused as to what you order. Perhaps this is a new location and they need to work out the kinks. Cost: The one and two meat plates are both $14, and both come with two sides. The three meat costs $18. It's not super pricey, but you'll see that you don't get a lot portion wise either. When we went back a second time and got a three meat plate, that was literally 2 slices of brisket, 2 baby back ribs, and 1 pork rib. Overall: Parking is plenty in the shared lot outside. Space is open and clean, but you will come out smoky, as with most BBQ places. Best thing is the sausage, and we'll come back for that if nothing else.

Southside has been in business since the 1800s and this is their first location inside Austin after the original in Elgin and the second location in Bastrop.Why does Southside excel?  Simple. They've got the BBQ business model down.  Great BBQ (which I'll discuss in depth) and a well run business.  The lines move quickly; the staff is friendly; the place is clean; and most importantly, they rarely run out of meat.BBQ?  On point.  I tried the three meat plate.  The moist brisket was sliced well and had a nice bark and smoke ring.  The pork steak was well done and is one of the better pork BBQ dishes out there.  The baby back ribs are also on point with being well done and having a good seasoning to them. My dining companion liked her jalapeno cheddar sausage's kick as well as the visible pieces of jalapeno and cheddar, but said it could've used a bit more time in the pit.  She said the turkey might be the best she's had and that she's planning to come back to pick up turkey to bring home for sandwiches. Pro tip:  If you're a sauce fan, their Texas Bold sauce is among the best options out there.  It's a great complement to their meat and adds just enough flavor and heat to complement anything you try there.They've got a good variety of baked desserts and an ice cream counter serving Blue Bell, but neither of us had room.Definitely adding to my regular dining rotation. Being able to get great BBQ during regular business hours is something that a lot of the new places around Austin could learn from.","Longwood, Orlando, FL",0,102,21,"[54.0, 25.0, 7.0, 8.0, 8.0]",Aug-09,80,19,36,['never']

The moist brisket we got at Southside was very greasy and had a thick line of rubbery fat in it which could have been rendered better. Good flavor.Lamb rib was good but salty.

Also, they were perfectly cooked not mushy, falling apart.The mac n cheese was creamy. A bit on the thick side for my taste but others might prefer it that way. The vinegary coleslaw (they have a cream based one which I didn't try) looked fresh and tasted pretty good. I've been to many places where cabbage is partially wilting and has a soggy texture, but not the case here at all. I'm not sure if they make their own bbq sauce but if they do, I need to go back and buy some to take home. I liked that it wasn't too peppery nor all sugared up - it was well balanced. Lastly, as far as sides go, tater tot casserole was yummy! Must try it if you like the potato flavor of french fries and light creaminess of mac n cheese with bits of crispy, fried tater tater tot edges. I also had their moist brisket, smoked turkey breast and chicken. As far as the brisket and chicken goes, I prefer Rudy's (not going to compare with the more well known bbq joints).

The Salt Lick location in Round Rock is where it all started. As a foodie, I was intrigued that their sauce is not tomato based, yet it still has a rich sweet taste (sugar in their sauce helps get that signature caramelization). I tried four of their meats and four sides as part of a take-out order for a fundraiser they were supporting for William's Community School.  The Brisket was my favorite.  They baste all their meats four times during the cooking process.  The bark on the Brisket had a ton of flavor and was perfectly moist inside. I tried the pork ribs second. The meat easily tore off the bone and was tender, however I thought my other choices the sausage and smoked turkey were better.  The sausage is made up of a beef/pork mix.  They smoke it for almost four hours.  I suggest using their spicy BBQ sauce with it.  The flavor really pops.  Finally, the smoked turkey was probably second to the Brisket.  I think some places overcook or over smoke it and the meat becomes dry.  Not at Salt Lick, moist as their other meats and great with the sweeter sauce. Sides, well they take up room where you could just eat more meat.  But if you're asking, go with the Slaw, Mac N Cheese and Potato Salad. My wife would add their sweet potato fries. Didn't eat in so no view on the ambiance or service.  Prices were fair and what you would expect for good BBQ.","Wexford, PA",6,147,258,"[38.0, 39.0, 34.0, 18.0, 18.0]",Jun-16,133,42,31,"['Elite 2021', '’20', '’19', '’18']"

The burnt ends were almost like sliced pieces of fatty portion so moist and well seasoned. Mac and cheese was really good definitely worth getting again. Ribs were good but we're on the large side for pork. Sausage was pretty good. Turkey was good, moist but don't know if we would order it again since the brisket was so good and we aren't turkey people but would make a great sandwich. Pulled pork was just alright.

She recommended the Salt Lick for some amazing bbq. Once we pulled up you could smell the bbq in the air. During Covid time you can dine outside under the tree with no masks at the table, inside the ac once you get to the table you can take off mask, or order to pick up. I loved the play area for the kids. It's very family friendly. Saw a baseball team chowing down. Lots of visitors from other towns or cities or out of state travelers. In fact I met a mom in line who lived in the city next to me in my hometown small world. Everyone's so nice here. Our hostess and server were hard workers. My agent got the all you can eat portion for $26.95. She said don't waste your appetite on the coleslaw beans or potato salad go for the beef brisket and pork ribs it also comes with sausage but she didn't order that. You are allowed to bring it home with you if you don't finish it. I ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich and waffle fries to make it a plate. It arrived and oh man was this sandwich huge the bun, pulled pork, and sauce was the best I've ever had! It was served with a pickle and onion on side. My basket of waffle fries was gigantic I'm like who's all this for wow they do not skimp here. Best waffle fries ever. We both had the sweet tea (I had lemon on the side). Here's the funny part, our server kept dropping off new cups of sweet tea refills I was nursing my first one I never knew that was going to be a thing I'm so used to one cup and that's it. Nope not here it keeps coming without being asked. The more the merrier and everything is bigger in Texas-love it. Another plate of pickles and onions arrived too. I was stuffed to the brim I didn't even cut my sandwich in half she took a pic of me stuffing my face. Now the bar area and the smoker with sausage was all blocked off for covid time so I had to take photos thru the plexiglass. The pies looked like granny just baked them-they looked perfect all lined up-what a treat. You can enjoy the half cobbler or half berry pie if you can't decide. Overall, this is a nice casual option if you're in the mood for some best tasting local style Texas BBQ. The menu is not elaborate it's plain and simple with all the best food items to chose from. The seating is spaced out inside and outside. The customer service is marvelous and I would come back here in a heart beat.","North Las Vegas, NV",1037,28,8,"[19.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 8.0]",Jun-16,15,0,5,['never']

EATS- I got the Friday special which is the half chickenplate comes with two sides. I really liked the chicken it was very moist and tender *tigger words sorry*. I got the peach habanero bbq sauce to go with it and it was tasty! For sides i tried to keep it healthy side salad and their broccoli salad. Broccoli salad was actually really good! Was dressed in their Italian style dressing. Probs will get a double portion next time. My husband got the two meat plate (brisket and pork ribs) we love their pork ribs flavor and the brisket is pretty tender too. He got it topped with spicy bbq sauce. For his sides, he got the cornbread casserole and potato salad. I really liked the potato salad a lot! Has a bit of mustard flavor to it which i like ! Cornbread casserole was okay but fell flat for me. Take it or leave it. Worth- I'd say it's good size portions And decent quality food. However after tip i spend about $40 on two meals. Kinda feels a bit much for me. Drinks- self serve soft drinks, water, tea sweet and unsweet! Service - greeted quickly upon walking in and a bunch friendly guys working there!

One other thing I need to mention is that we felt very safe with the service they provided.  The staff all wore masks and gloves and they plated the food in a way that made us feel comfortable given today's conditions.  We worked with Anna to set up catering.  She helped to walk us through the process of selecting the meal options and the contract.  She was extremely helpful and a pleasure to work with.And in the end, one of the main reasons we loved working with Pok-E-Jos is that they were almost invisible.  They were so professional and did all of the setup and tear down of the services that they provided that we hardly even noticed them there.  They provided us with a great meal and we had no complaints.Thank you Pok-e-Jos for helping to make our wedding extra special.","Austin, TX",38,13,4,"[8.0, 4.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]",Jul-19,1,0,1,['never']

So I'm gonna break down our feedback the best we can.Meat & Sauce:Sauce - 1.5 out of 5 - It's just odd, not sure what they are going for... vinegar and tomato? It's like North Carolina and Texas had an alien baby. Needs some re-thinking... Try making 3 originals for everyone.Brisket - 3 out of 5 - without sauce, it's just dry. The smoke is there... but just Clark Griswold choke on a bone dry. (also you know how I feel about the sauce already)Pork - 3.5 out of 5 - Good flavor, but still dry... needs a different sauce than that odd Vinegar hybrid. I recommend a thick red sauce or mustard-based bbq sauce like South Carolina. If you don't like mustard base check out Meat Churches sauces. I'm sure they can recommend something fantastic.Not Edible:Cole Slaw - 0 out of 5 - reminds me of elementary school. Plain horrible.Greenbean Casserole - 0 out of 5 - reminds me of BBQs with a drunk friend that brought that 1 dish they destroyed from a family member... Plain horrible.FANTASTIC!!:Potato Salad - 5 out of 5 - hands down some of the best potato salad I've ever had!! This stuff is on point! Grab a tub or bucket of this stuff because it's fantastic!!!Fries & Okra - 3.5 out of 5 - I mean how can you mess up fried Okra and French fries... but they did need more salt.Summary:This place is decent for a craving but it's just commercial BBQ.

The meat portion size was okay and I guess within normal range of most BBQ restaurants. The restaurant itself was nice, spacious with tables & booths and a couple of TVs! Unfortunately the food was awfully bland! The turkey and brisket had no flavor to it and the same can be said of the  potato salad and pinto beans! I was excited to try this place out, but was let down by the taste of the food. It's almost like it was not seasoned at all. Maybe I went on a day where the prep cook forgot to season the food! Also the bar with the pickles and onions had nets flying around it which was interesting as the place was pretty clean. The AC was running and the fans were on which probably attributed to my food getting cold fast, I placed a picture of the food so you can see how good it looks; looks can be deceiving! As far as the price I paid the meal was almost $17 for for the 2 meat plate and a drink which sounds about right for what I got.

I'm not even joking it was for little rounds for two dollars!!I I ordered that tiny amount of sausage and not much brisket and turkey. It was just about one plate full and I paid $16 for that and one side!!! The brisket was moist but it taste a bit like rubbing alcohol. The tater tot casserole was kind of gross.

You order your meat right when you walk in. It's very awkward especially if you have never been there. We stepped back to look at the menu and let others go ahead of us. We ended up ordering 1/2lb of brisket and a half rack of ""sweet & spicy"" baby back ribs. We took our meats to get weighted and ended up paying for nearly 1/4lb more of brisket than we ordered. After picking our sides and paying, we headed to our seat when I noticed an area with free beans, bread, pickles. I could not find plates anywhere! I noticed people looked like they were eating off of paper, which I eventually found back at the register. I ordered the fatty brisket because I was told by the employee it would be more moist and the other drier. It was not very moist at all and I would hate to find out what the dry version was like. I'm a huge brisket fan, but I really didn't find this brisket exciting. My son said the ""sweet and spicy"" ribs were just SPICY and didn't care to eat them. My husband said they were good. The sides-ugh! The Mac and cheese was watery and flavorless with burnt pieces in it. The tater casserole tasted like tuna casserole with potato instead of noodles.

Didn't plan on eating early, but when you're close to a great BBQ spot, you have to eat when you're there. Driving by, we made a quick turn and had a second hobbit breakfast.The place was pretty new for a BBQ joint and looked very open and nice. Very heavy rustic/modern furniture well spaced apart. There were only a few tables taken, but it could hold an army.They don't have any two meat specials so I just ordered by the weight which is the way they roll. I got a 1/4 pound of lean brisket and pork tenderloin and the cutter hit it spot on. That's impressive.The brisket had a perfect rind of smoke and a great looking bark. The brisket meat was very flavorful and spot on. I'd easily rate it at 4+. It tasted awesome. The pork tenderloin was nice and juicy, but wasn't even warm. All the meats were served from a warming pit, but this must not have been in it long from the cooler. Tasted good, but wanted it a bit warm. For sides I started off with their craisin-almond cole slaw. Their smallest container was enough for three. Really wished that it started smaller than that. But, it was divine! Lots of sweet cranberries & raisins with sliced almonds in the slaw. Could have been a dessert!I also ordered the creamed corn. For some odd reason, it came in an individual size. Liked that! The server warned me that it came with a bite. He wasn't kidding. I really liked it. Creamy corn, not too sweet with a lingering kick.In the middle of the restaurant are some fixings. If you eat in, you can put some into individual containers:- Very sweet BBQ sauce that was watered down. It was in a huge hot pot so I get that it likely flows like water.- Pintos were well cooked. Warm, temperature wise. At first no flavor until I realized the creamed corn cooked out all my taste buds! Once they returned it had a wonderful, warming ham welcome.- Butter beans were a nice surprise. Hadn't had them in a while and these were perfect! I'm usually not a fan, but wish I had more room for more of them.- Onions were very fresh. However they were strong yellow onion-like so be ware.- Noticeably absent was any bread slices. Usually BBQ spots have them. Didn't really miss them much.This is definitely a great place to eat. If you drive by and see a full parking lot, don't worry. The place is ginormous inside and most of the parking can be found in the back.","Austin, TX",88,12,0,"[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0]",Dec-12,9,2,1,['never']

However I DID NOT like that the bbq (meats) is literally at the door, open for everyone to breath over. I immediately felt repulsed when a senior bent over and almost touched the ribs. Purchased a little of everything.  Pork ribs, brisket, sausage, pinto and butter beans, tatertot casserole, green beans and sampled all cobblers (pecan, peach and blackberry). The meats were ok. Favs we're the sausage and tatertot casserole. Omg that was GREAT. While the peach cobbler was pretty good (crusty and fresh Peaches) the Pecan cobbler will have you LITERALLY RUNNING TO THE DENTIST. MERCY ITS SWEET!  If you ask, they'll even give you ice cream from the back. Also loved that both beans were complimentary for those that sit in. Both huge pots stewing made me think back to my grandmother, in terms of appearance and flavor. 2nd best thing offered!

We've lived here about 3 years. We don't often go farther west than where we live, so it took quite some time before we ever actually ate there.We love barbecue. If you've read any of my other barbecue reviews, you know my stance. Barbecue should be able to stand on it's own. You shouldn't want, let alone need to put barbecue sauce on it. The flavors from the rub should be done well enough that you taste it in the meat and the smoke flavor from being smoked should be strong. A few places get this right, but not many. Opie's gets it very right! We have now had their food probably half a dozen times. And it's great. I sent friends there once recently and they were disappointed. I was shocked but when they explained what happened, I understood.When they went They had no brisket because apparently something had gone wrong with the smoker the night before. Then they had the pork ribs and they weren't that great. On top of that, they are gluten free so can't eat most of sides. Which means they don't get the best sides!So yesterday I had the chance to get Opie's back on their plates. We ordered a bunch of food from there for a get together at our house. We had to wait for a couple people. So by the time we got to eat, everything was cold and had been sitting a while.Well, everyone loved it! My friends who had the bad experience were raving and finally understood why I'd sent them there. (Keep in mind I talk about Opie's and a couple other amazing places all the time.) and all the new people were the same way. They all ate the food and loved it!Now a little about the food. The barbecue, all of it, is smokey. The rub they use is super tasty. There's gobs of flavor! And no need to use barbecue sauce unless you choose to.The sides are really good! The tatter tot casserole doesn't get any better than that. And their potato salad, cream corn and slaw are great too! I didn't try the beans yesterday so I don't remember how they are.All in all, fantastic barbecue! Great food!

It's a little pricy, but really not much more than any of the other big names in town, and still less than going to Franklin's or La BBQ and while they do sell out, I've never been caught in any crazy long lines or anything (though admittedly I usually visit Friday afternoon, and not on the weekend)I have had the brisket, Turkey, chicken, and smashed taters.  Everything is seriously delicious. The brisket has a great bark on it, with wonderful flavor, and a visible smoke ring. I have always only liked lean brisket. I still order the lean brisket here, but even then it still tends to come with at least a small layer of fat.  Anywhere else, that would be a problem, but here, that just melts in your mouth.  Personally I'd probably still have a problem with the ""fatty side"" because it would be a much larger piece of fat, but that said, it is cooked so well, that when getting just the small bit on a lean cut, it doesn't bother me at all, and that is really saying a lot.The smashed taters are one of my favorite things to order. These are red potatoes that I believe have been cooked in the bbq until they are ""baked"". Then, when ordered. They give them a nice little ""smash"" and fry them. They are good, but dipping them in that amazing bbq sauce really puts them over the top.  I highly highly highly recommend them, but don't forget to ask for an extra sauce or two for dipping.They also serve a variety of pickled items which I believe for the most part are ever changing. They make their pickles and pickled onions themselves which are served on the side of any bbq item.  Normally speaking when I got to pretty much any other bbq place, I tell them no pickles or onions, but not at Whitfields.  The pickles and pickled onions are awesome. Wish they served even more on the side (not that I feel that they don't put enough, they are just so good I want more)One of the other cool things they do, is just try out some new items here and there. You never know what they m if the have.  This past weekend it was homemade pimento cheese where they smoked the peppers themselves, and the ""bread sticks"" they served with it were so good, I could have eaten like two more bags of those without the cheese.Lastly, but in no way least, Kasey is just good people.  That guy is always so friendly, and when he isn't slammed in the truck cutting meat and making sure we are all fed, he is happy to shoot the shit.  I love talking football and fantasy football with him, but or course all my conversations with him have been great.  Definitely strikes me as the kind of dude you'd (or at least I) would want to hang out with and have a beer in ""real life"". Just one more of those ""just good people"" things. I'm sure they don't do this for every customer (because they would end up going out of business) but quite frequently when I come by, they have something ""new"" they are working on, and hand out a taste for free.  Now, I'm no on special here. Kasey doesn't know me from a hole in the wall other than the few times I've come by the truck, but even with just two guys working out of a food truck, Kasey understands how to make his customers feel special.I am not in the area a lot these days, so I don't get there as often as Whitfield's deserves to be frequented.  I really need to make more of an effort to head here though. Like I said, for my money this is right up there with the big boys if not even better, and far less of a hassle than even Terry Black's or Black's.If you're looking for damn good BBQ, you need to come and eat here","Austin, TX",134,70,7,"[8.0, 10.0, 12.0, 25.0, 15.0]",Jan-11,119,28,26,['never']

I live nearby and spotted the truck early this spring, but it wasn't until I saw the owner on KXAN that I really wanted to go (pictures do help!). The owner used to play for the Texans, and said in his KXAN segment that his chef ""looks like a kicker, but he's more like a quarterback in that he calls the plays."" Who doesn't love a team player? Kitchens have to run as fast and as smoothly as a football team to be successful. We got brisket tacos, shrimp tacos, and spare ribs. The ribs were peppery, tender, and smoky, and came with some perfect, house-made pickles and some sauce. Simple and delicious. The brisket tacos were loaded with tender, juicy meat. But they were only dressed with pickled onions and a little bit of avocado cream. A squeeze of lime or addition of crunchy pickles would have given some balance. The tacos were two for $10, which sounds expensive, but they  were not at all skimpy. I have the same minor complaint about the shrimp tacos. The shrimp was ceviche-style, and could have used some crunchy slaw or jicama to balance it out.

Next was the beans (two orders) which had a really nice acidic, vinegar flavor to it with some kind of tasty pickled relish that was balanced by a sweetness to it. Really enjoyed it. Ordered the smoked vegetables which was lacking any seasoning, and was overpowered by the smoke flavor. Didn't really care for. Also ordered the loaded potato salad. This was somewhat disappointing. Seems to have a little bit of cream cheese, but personally I would add sour cream (which is usually associated with a loaded baked potato) and lots more of it. Finally I got two orders of the peach cobbler. This was probably the most disappointing part of the meal. The ""crust"" or dough was way under cooked. So much so that I put 1 and 1/2 of the order in the oven at 350 degrees for almost 40 minutes!! Way under cooked. The dough had a consistency of day old porridge, lacked any flavoring, and the peaches were very firm. To sum up - brisket and beans, yes...definitely would reorder.

It is indeed very tasty and a nice twist on the traditional way of doing things.I think where they shine though is in their fries. They are sooo good!

Well ever since I saw them on Yelp and reading all the rave reviews. What sealed the deal was seeing them on Shark Tank. I was like well if the sharks like the food and my Yelper friends love it I NEED to try them out. We stopped in for a bite before heading over to the comedy club. Upon entering it had a hipster vibe. We ordered an order of kimchi fries with ribeye beef (for an extra $1) and 10 wings. We split the ten wings so we could try the Gangnam sauce and rooster sauce. The wings came with a spicy ranch for dipping and pickles.The food came out promptly and I believe that was because it was the day after Thanksgiving so no one was really out and about for dinner.  Anyway, the food looked amazing and then my husband and I both dug in I have had Korean wings before at a little place called Bonchon. There is not a bonchon in Austin but they have locations all around the country and even located outside the US. Anyway, this Korean style wing is nothing in comparison. Out of the flavoring I did like the Gangnam style better than the rooster sauce. Neither to me were close to being spicy. I felt the wings were just lacking. Moving on to the famous kimchi fries. Again I believe chilantro fell short. The fries were crispy but I have had kimchi fries before. I actually had them at a Yelp event that Whole Foods held. The kimchi fries there were amazing there but these fries at chilantro just were meh. What gives?I am wondering if this was a miss day or honestly chilantro is just all hype? One can only wonder and now I marked this off a place that I tried but won't be back.","Austin, TX",1182,1885,1856,"[375.0, 723.0, 521.0, 201.0, 65.0]",Sep-09,12557,5045,9684,"['Elite 2021', '’20', '’19', '’18', '’17', '’16', '’15', '’14', '’13']"

I had the Kimchi fries w/the bulgogi and it definitely lived up to the hype. The fries were a meal in and of themselves and the meat was so tender and flavorful as were the fries themselves (I had initially scoffed at the serving price, but you definitely get your money's worth). The menagerie of flavors and texture of the fries to the meat were very complementary.I was even given an introduction to the menu by the very friendly and engaging staff on my first visit as I was a little wary as to what to expect, but I was put at ease and felt like I had been initiated to Club Chi' (I'm was just waiting for my secret handshake and members only jacket).To say I was a bit smitten on my first visit would be an understatement. So when I came in for my second visit a few weeks later, I was expecting the same sort of Cloud 9 experience. Sadly, I think the spell was broken.On my second visit, I came w/friends instead of solo; we came on a weekend, so the place was packed vs on my first visit it was later on a weekday and I was basically the only person in the place, but I am of the philosophy that regardless of time of day or day of the week a place this good should be consistently good and on my second visit, things were nowhere as good as the first time.I got the exact same order as I had the first time and this time the meat had a weird sort of aftertaste to it that I could not quite put my finger on, but it was a bit off-putting. Also, the fries themselves this time were not fresh and perfectly crispy like they were the first time. They tasted a bit greasy and were a bit on the soggy/mushy side. And maybe it was those two things that put the flavors I had fallen in love w/the first time on the off-track as well, but everything just seemed to be out of whack. My friends had ordered some tacos and they told me that they didn't understand what I was raving about it.  Needless to say, I left feeling a bit betrayed.However, I do plan on giving my fries another try because they really were that good the first time and even though the second time was subpar, I am willing to give this place the benefit of the doubt because I know what they are capable of.

Food: what caught me off guard is that this place is not like the typical chilantro unless they changed their whole dynamic at all of the other places. I have been with them since they opened their food truck and the food quality is not the same as before. There is no burger option at this location and everything is serve chipotle style. The kimchi fries were crispy but I was given half of the account of fries I would usually be given and they put way more kimchi than chicken this time. I'm not sure if the workers are just new and are not used to the menu? Overall I think it's pretty decent for what they are. I would probably go back to their Lamar location (unless they changed that place too). I think I would give them a chance once they established the place. The fries were meh compared to all of the other times I tried it. Other than that this is the nicest location they have!","Austin, TX",526,101,61,"[42.0, 35.0, 16.0, 4.0, 4.0]",Jun-14,557,232,422,"['Elite 2019', '’18', '’17']"

The two big smokers out back are producing Fabu BBQ that rivals their original venue. Their brisket is moist, not over spiced, and have has a beautiful smoke ring. Their St Louis ribs are AOK with a nice peppery crust. Like a spicy sausage then order their jalapeno link.I'm not a sides guy as I prefer to load up on protein, but.... their pinto beans with brisket is spicy and full of awesomeness. Their coleslaw has a nice spicy surprise as well. My Plus 1 was also raving about their Mac and cheese.Last but certainly not least service is top-notch and friendly with frequent check-ins while you are dining. There are plenty of TVs both inside and on their patio. They also have a decent craft beer selection on tap.Don't be discouraged if there is a long line. Everyone is six feet apart and the line moves fast.

Her peach cobbler had a crust more like cake than a cobbler crust, which overwhelmed the few peaches at the bottom of the container. As we were leaving, we also noticed that you didn't smell the smoke and BBQ like you do at the original location.The service at this location is beyond friendly, just like the original location.  However, they have a hard time keeping up with the crowds, especially in the line.  The line regularly backed up and any sort of to-go order, especially a large order, brought the line to a virtual standstill.  Also, the drink area ran out of ice and we had to find two different members of their team before we managed to get ice for our drinks.I still love Stiles Switch, but I'm definitely staying with the original location.","Austin, TX",193,1110,0,"[375.0, 425.0, 203.0, 67.0, 40.0]",May-11,5212,3832,4033,"['Elite 2021', '’20', '’19', '’18', '’17', '’16', '’15', '’14']"

The line was short when I went in but by the time I was leaving the lines were long and growing.I ordered the two meat plate with pork ribs, sausage, tomato & cucumber salad, and potato salad. Oh, and pickles. It was quick to prepare my to go box. At the cashier, I paid my $20. plus (Not Cheap) Head  out to go home and eat.Everything was squeezed into one normal size takeout box.  It was heavy. Opening it up, I first sliced some sausage and tried it. It was good, slightly spiced but not hot, good chew and snap. The potato salad was where my fork picked next. Potatoes cooked through without being mushy, not overdone with mayo, had some flavor, again it was good. Onto the rib, can you say peppery.  It was a definite pepper taste but if you add the BBQ sauce, it killed some of the pepper. I finished it in record time because there was hardly any meat on it. Too bad as pork ribs are my favorite.  Finally taste was the tomato/cucumber salad, I asked for the feta cheese on top and it was barely there. The dressing was also barely there. It was bland so I added some  dressing and more feta and it was better.Well, I tried it and most likely won't go again. It is very pricey for what you get. My two meat plate came with 3 ribs and a 6 inch sausage, the salad were 1/4 cup.

They are very seasoned fries so if you liked seasoned fries, these are for you. I also like their corn casserole dish. I think the sides all depends on the person. I personally like different sides than what they serve and that's ok. I wish they would change them up sometimes. However, i did learn when I was just in, that they have special food on some days and to check their social media to see when they post about it. For example they just had chicken enchiladas that sounded delicious. Also, their ribs are really really good. Honestly all the meat their is amazing and you can't go wrong.

The cool thing was they did offer a free beer ( Coors or Miller light) once when I was in line- I politely decline. But that seemed more random that at an interval - took me 40+ minutes or so to get through the line and saw them offer the beer once. Cool gesture. Guy manning the door was nice. I got a to-go order and unfortunately you cannot order online or call in orders which is frustrating. I got a 3 meat plate with 2 sides. We got the brisket ( above average), sausage(average), and jalapeño sausage(really good). Our two sides were mac and cheese - it was mild cheese and better than average and a tomato/cucumber salad. That 3 meat plate was able to feed myself, my wife and my son. Yeah we could have ate more but we don't want to stuff ourselves. Side proportions were pretty small imo.  Inside looked awesome!

Its a great place to bring folks, very cozy seating and inviting atmosphere. Waited for the post launch hype to die down to avoid the crazy lines and went on a Thursday afternoon, and thankfully we hit it at a lull. I particularly like Stiles for the sides, that always stood out. They do things a little different from most joints. The meats were great- Brisket was moist and fresh, ribs fell off the bone, pulled pork was a bit lacking in seasoning though. I think the bbq sauce was unusually watery during this visit which kind of dampened my enjoyment of that meat. Probably a fluke but worth noting. This is one of the few joints with fries, and they're amazing. Try out the hawg fries, the potato salad is buttery and fresh, the beans have brisket in them and they offer a lighter cucumber and tomato salad. All the sides are elevated compared to other joints. And if you're a Coke or Pepsi fan, worth noting this is a Pepsi joint (minor disappointment). Either way, awesome to have this joint in Cedar Park!

The cost is high.  BBQ has really come up in recent years.  These guys are riding that wave and charging a premium for their product.  Sandwiches are around $15.  My plate was $20.  The beef rib was listed at $27.  For lunch, that is just a high number.  Some don't mind paying that.  Some definitely will. Overall, I had a nice lunch.  I even took some home as leftovers.   Would I eat there again?  You bet.  Would I choose this place over other BBQ options?  Probably not.   My impression is that these guys want to be to BBQ what Hopdoddy's is to burgers.  Nothing wrong with that as it certainly appeals to many folks that like good food but also want to be seen doing the cool thing at the cool place.  For an average person, this is probably more of a special reason to go kind of place.","Cedar Park, TX",0,3,14,[],Jul-16,1,1,0,['never']

There were a few folks already in line and seated.  My wife ordered the brisket and jalapeño sausage plate. I went straight brisket with most burnt ends.  The brisket was cut thick.  Perfect amount of fat. The sausage had a good grind and nice snap.  Both had a deep flavor of smoke.   The Hawg Rub fries had excellent amount of spice and needed no sauce or ketchup.  The pinto beans with brisket was really good and reminds me of my late Meemaw's beans.  Corn casserole is good as is the cucumber/tomato salad.  Very fresh.

Well, today I took a chance and ordered chop beef sandwich for delivery. Not only do I have minced beef in a cup of grease, it wasn't even on bun like it used to be.

Very nice decor with a warm comforting feel. Staff was pretty friendly.Order: 2 meat plate- brisket, ribs, potato salad, pinto beansBrisket is claimed to be Prime, this is likely the case as the meat was outstanding quality. I wish more places offered quality meat for their price. Cooked perfectly with tons of moisture with a nice crust around it. Disappointing though as there was little seasoning flavor to it. Better than most briskets in the area just due to their cooking techniques and meat quality. If you enjoy fantastically cooked brisket with little seasoning this would be great for you. Ribs had more flavor than the brisket with a nice sweet, and peppery exterior. Cooked just as well as the brisket, and came off the bone nice and easy. Potato salad was pretty good, I believe it is mayonnaise based, and had a decent flavor profile. Would like to see a mustard based salad as well.Pinto beans were the best things I had on the plate. Seasoned with a good hand of pepper and other seasonings. Definitely had the most flavor on the plate. Highly recommend.Sauces: the house bbq sauce was okay. Seemed heavy on the tomato base with little attention to other bbq profiles. Not particularly sweet or savory. Would like to see more of a traditional bbq flavor out of it.I found myself using their mustard sauce on the table more than their bbq sauce. Decent seasoning to it with more of a basic bbq profile.Overall great atmosphere and better than most bbq places around. I would have liked to have more meat, on the ribs or an extra half of a slice of brisket to completely fill me up (I am a smaller person). For the price the quality was good but the portions were a tiny bit small. The seasonings could be improved but for most people would likely be fine.

Arriving just as the breakfast crowd was trickling out, we were greeted with the delicious smell of slow cooked meat. The expansive menu board boasted a wide selection of plates, sandwiches, sides and more. We both had sliced brisket sandwiches, with a side of onion rings, and sweet tea. The brisket was so tender it was falling apart, and a very generous portion on our sandwiches. Served on the side, the barbeque sauce was warmed, tangy, and the perfect balance between thick and thin in consistency. Almost more food than we could eat, we moved on to the onion rings; which were crispy, and didn't turn into a greasy mush while they were ignored momentarily, as we shoveled brisket into our mouths. My only very slight complaint was that the sandwich was served on generic store bought sandwich bread...and there were no toothpicks.

Not too visually pleasing, but don't let that deter you. It has a small dining room or you can drive thru. They offer daily lunch specials from 11AM-2PM. I ordered the sliced brisket sandwich with pinto beans and two pork ribs. My husband ordered the chopped beef sandwich and potatoes salad. Onions and pickles are available upon request. My brisket sandwich had a very generous portion of sliced, moist brisket. It was tender with decent flavor. I would have preferred a bit more of a smoked taste, but it was good. If you order the sides the small is super small. The beans were ok, not overly seasoned, but not bland either. I would have given this place at least 3.5 stars, but my husbands experience was not quite up to par. He did not like the chopped beef sandwich. It was not chopped fresh when ordered and he felt that it was pre-made and stored. The potato salad was chunky and not whipped. He agreed with me that the rib that I shared with him was tender and flavorful. Just FYI the bbq sauces available on the table were not impressive, but ok. The biggest thing for him was that the restaurant had a stale smell. I suffer from bad allergies, so I wouldn't know.

Anyone will tell you that Rudy's is hit or miss. I got a bit tired of the miss part of my Rudy's experience and decided to come back and give Liberty a try again. Maybe they have cock now.  I wondered.Went in one afternoon and got the ribs along with two sides. I'm not a big fan of any of their sides but will say the cucumber salad is nice and refreshing. I got the pork ribs and was really impressed with them. Nice, tender, meaty and delicious. Couldn't wait to come back. I think that was on a weekday afternoon. There was still no cock on the menu, but I did notice they have daily specials that are written on the blackboard at the end of the bar.On my next visit it was a Saturday. I had finished a good workout and was in need of some good protein to feed my starving muscles. I was craving the ""Q"". I went back to Liberty.  I walked in and grabbed a seat near the end of the bar and low and behold the daily special was cock!!!  Halleluiah!!  1/2 chicken plate with two sides. Fuck yeah!  I'm all in.  That was some damn good smoked chicken. Nice smoky flavor and the meat was not overdone like at most places. It was tender and juicy. I keep going back for the chicken and ribs on a regular basis. I have made many trips as either dine in or to go and they remain consistent with the quality of the meats. I will keep coming back here for sure.   Before you visit you may want to call ahead and see what the daily special is.

Finally, the sauce is a bit different as it's almost got a pulp-like texture and doesn't add much to the BBQ.  It's not bad and the great news is that the BBQ doesn't really need sauce.  Having said that though, I'm usually a fan of a thinner, spicier sauce.All in all, Liberty BBQ is excellent.  The few hiccups I've noted should not dissuade you from trying them out -- especially if you want BBQ for dinner -- and even more so if you want table service and a full bar.","Austin, TX",192,765,1138,"[336.0, 261.0, 104.0, 44.0, 20.0]",May-11,861,295,408,"['Elite 2021', '’20', '’19', '’18', '’17', '’16']"

Beans has plenty of flavor, fries are well seasoned and crisp, and the Mac and cheese was really tasty (kind of a queso mac - not particularly kid friendly). There's room for improvement however - potato salad was bland, turkey was flavorless, and bbq sauce had a weird salsa texture (also kind of overly sweet).

We ordered 1-meat platters for my teenage kids and a 2-meat platter for me. Everyone had the brisket and I decided to try the boudin as well. Sides were mac n cheese as well as beans. Let's break it down:The Bad-Ordered our meal online and went to pick it up at the appointed time. Food was not ready. In fact it took 30 minutes after I got there for the food to be ready. In fact shortly after I got there I was told they were bagging my order. It didn't come out for a good while longer and later I was told that they had run out of brisket and were having to cut a new brisket. I feel that slicing brisket at a barbecue place is something that should be able to be done with your eyes closed and not take 30 minutes to happen, but putting that aside I figured I would get nice hot food. -The food was Luke warm at best. I ended up throwing mine in the microwave once I got home (not a long enough trip to cool off that much) just to get it warmed up. -I felt like the portions in the meat platter were all over the place. There wasn't much brisket to speak of but there was a lot of the boudin and the sides. The Good-Once it was warmed up the brisket was actually quite tasty, honestly if I had had more it could have pulled another star out for this review. -The mac n cheese was fantastic, and the quantity was great. (though I could have eaten more without hesitating)-My oldest said that the beans were good too. -On seeing me waiting for my order, the general manager did come up to me and apologize for the wait and offered to make it up to me on a future visit. It was nice that he was proactive about it. The Okay-I thought the boudin was alright. I ordered the two meat platter so that I could have brisket, the staple of a TX bbq joint, and try something new. I haven't had a lot of boudin in the past (this is only the second time) so take this opinion with a grain of salt, but I definitely thought the Cajun place down the road had better boudin (which I guess kind of makes sense). Final thoughtsMost of the food at Liberty BBQ was pretty good. If I had come here on another night and not had timing/temperature issues with the food or if there weren't some challenges with the portion sizes of the brisket then this place could easily have gotten another star, maybe more. I'll check it out another time and report back what I find.","Hidden Glen, Round Rock, TX",43,386,138,"[171.0, 156.0, 36.0, 20.0, 3.0]",Sep-08,631,107,235,"['Elite 2021', '’20', '’19', '’18', '’17', '’16', '’15', '’14', '’13', '’12']"

Both tasted good, but the smoked turkey was a bit drier than I prefer and had less smokey taste. The brisket was cut from the fat end of the slab. I tend to like a bit leaner brisket. Having said all that both were good and tasty.Their sides and condiments were first class. Homemade pickles and pickled onions were a hit on my plate as was the jalapeno slaw.

The rest of this discussion is about 3 star bbq.First, I was looking for a BBQ JOINT that wasnt salt lick as I passed through RR. They excel in that dept. However i use BBQ slightly tongue in cheek because this place is really a bar that wasnt a 51% business, and didnt get forcibly closed by our Governor at the moment. While Im happy they were able to stay open, if youre looking for a true TX bbq experience (wait in line and see the pits, the slicer taking cut orders, etc) this is not where you want to go. This is a bar that serves a decent plate of food. It smells like a bar, feels like a bar and looks like a bar - and you know what mama always said about looking, walking and quacking like a duck...The food was decent - but its bar food. MAYBE Chilis level, because you dont have to drink here and you can sit in a booth. In fact its a lot like a chilis. You may give it 5 stars for that. Nothing wrong there, but thats not what I picture when a place has BBQ in its name. I imagine that pre covid, this was a popular, decent hang out that you could socialize in over drinks AND grab a decent dinner without waiting in a Austin BBQ line for hours. I would definitely come back again after this is over for just that kind of experience - but not when I wanted  a Tx BBQ experience.","Mesquite, TX",56,86,24,"[41.0, 4.0, 3.0, 8.0, 30.0]",May-11,149,64,43,['never']

So, I ordered two huge baked potatoes, a quart of mac and cheese and a quart of creamed corn. Probably not the healthiest meal (s) but I make my own healthy food and buy treats. It was delivered quickly, while it was still hot. The corn was actually almost too hot! I give it four stars because I had low expectations and it met them just fine.  It satisfied my baked potato craving and I'm a happy girl! The mac and cheese tastes like cafeteria mac and cheese, but sometimes I like it that way. The creamed corn was sweet and rich and soupy. The baked potatoes were huge, and hard to mess up, but could have used more toppings. This much food will last me for days, and was worth the deal from Uber, but I wouldn't have felt like I got my money's worth in quality if I paid for it. For the same amount of money, you could get slightly better food from bbq chains.I asked for no silverware and minimal packaging but they still wasted a bunch of paper and plastic by sending utensils, napkins, and wrapping the containers in plastic before placing them in bags.It's not too likely I'll be back for more, because there's better bbq in town, and I should just make my own baked potatoes, but if I find myself without potatoes in my kitchen I might come by for a baked potato again.","Austin, TX",362,113,211,"[60.0, 39.0, 7.0, 5.0, 2.0]",Mar-14,143,47,140,"['Elite 2021', '’20']"

Did I get the first 3-star experience or are the other ratings from friends/easily forgiven? I'm hoping the former and look forward to another try.We came at about 6:00pm on a Friday and it was packed! That's a good sign. There's parking on both sides, so don't get concerned if the first one is full. Seems like there's more beyond the restaurant. There was about a 30 minute wait so we decided to eat on the porch. It was a very windy, cool day but once on the closed in porch it was quite pleasant. Those who came even later and decided to sit outside were in for a real cool meal.The waitress was very good & nice and working through being in a new restaurant. The only foul was not ever coming back to refill the waters. She was busy. The back porch area overlooks the outdoor games that really do a good job in keeping the kiddos busy. Look forward to a musician on the corner stage.We decide to go all in. We got both the Cooper (enough for 3-4 people as it was 1# of brisket, 1# of turkey and three sausages with three large sides) and a full rack of ribs for the four of us. It was way more than we could handle and will be eating leftovers for a while.Sadly, the mix of sides beat out the mix of meats. I really LOVED the baked beans. Everyone did and there were no left overs. The creamed corn tasted good but had a weird texture. Some how there were chunks of white cream(?) in there. It either wasn't properly mixed or went through a weird cooling. The mac & cheese was good and I liked the bacon add to it. Good touch there. It was the kids version of mac & cheese (focus on cheese with pasta as an afterthought) rather than the adult style (focus on pasta with cheese lightly added). All enjoyed it but it was just par, certainly not a 5-ringer.The meats just didn't do it. I'm hoping that they are working out the restaurant volume as this wasn't what I had experienced before when they were a food truck. The ribs were great. Go with those! Tasted well, cooked well. What more could you ask for? The brisket was whelming at best. Not over- or under-. You had to work to chew it and even had to use a knife to cut it up. It was like it spent more time waiting to be served than it was cooked. So it spent a while somewhere. I'm hoping they dial this in or return to the food truck effort. We had both the jalapeno/cheese and pepper jack/garlic styles. Both were way overpowering in the flavor department. I hope they offer a plain flavor somewhere or dial that down. I can handle heat and wild flavors, but these were potent. Maybe I needed a beer or two. Finally the turkey just plain didn't work. It was very overcooked/rubbery. All three of the core BBQ items were not near what I had expected and doubt it's the weather. I think they just haven't dialed in the production.I look forward to coming to the restaurant again and trying to revise the review. Hopefully you get the experience of one of the others.","Austin, TX",104,123,25,"[57.0, 54.0, 7.0, 3.0, 2.0]",Jun-10,100,21,49,"['Elite 2021', '’20']"

I drive back and tell them they gave me the wrong order. Not a single apology, just ""ok, this ones yours then."" Drive home, guess what? Completely botched my order. Said no onions, they put onions on it. Didn't ask for jalapeños; covered in jalapeños. This is the 2nd of 2 times I have ordered online and they have screwed it up both times. Doesn't matter how good the potential for their food is. It's always wrong, the guys who work there are the least attentive fast food workers I've ever seen, and that's saying something. Legitimately wish I could post a 0 star review. Please clean house and find somewhat competent people to fulfill very simple day to day duties.","San Antonio, TX",475,2,0,[],Jun-15,0,0,0,['never']

You'll have no regrets!Meyer's Smokehouse has a cross-town rival in Southside Market & BBQ, but they seem to have embraced the 'Smokehouse' part of their identity a little more thoroughly than SSM&BBQ. Not to mention that they have awesomely named sandwiches (Pigzilla or Cowabunga, anyone?)I tried the three meat plate with mac n' cheese and creamed corn as sides. Both sides were okay, though they really need to up the gas on the steam table to keep things a little warmer! Brisket is supposed to be the 'crowning jewel' of Texas BBQ - see my reviews, I eat waaaay too much 'cue than I should.  What I received was so-so in my book.  A nice smoky flavor but a bit bland.  On the other hand, the smoked quarter chicken was amazing, one of the best I've had.  I'm planning on coming back to try their variation on this theme, the lime-pepper chicken, just for that.Finally, I worked my way to their standard beef sausage and gave it a bite.  The skin made the perfect 'snap' just as the juice and smoky flavor detonated on my tongue in a nuclear bomb of deliciousness. Wow, this was *good*!!! I have no idea if you can create this by purchasing their sausage at home unless you have a smoker, but this sausage impressed me with the overall flavor and a nip of heat at the end.Definitely worth a visit to Elgin (45 mins from Central Austin).This place scores a 4 out of 5 on the 'CTJ Scale', as noted below.5 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Jesus good. Would be OK passing away after finishing a plate here.4 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Mary good. Would be OK being seen eating here by Mother Mary.3 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Joseph good. Would be OK having a beer here with Jesus' Dad.2 out of 5 stars: Come-to-the-Apostles good. Meh. Wouldn't have my last supper here.1 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Nobody good. I wouldn't have my penultimate supper here, either.","Bullard, TX",0,10,1,"[7.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]",May-20,0,0,0,['never']

I've been going to Meyer's for probably 15 to 20 years, maybe longer. It's probably remained great because they are family owned and operated. A small business. I don't live in the area, but my bosses were in Austin and I drive past Meyer's monthly, sometimes weekly. They've remodeled, so it is much nicer than when I started going there. Their food is my favorite, especially their beef sausage. We do online orders for my father-in-law in North Carolina for his birthday and Father's Day and he loves it. The flavor of the sausage can't be beat. Their other items (chicken, beef and turkey) are also great. They also have great BBQ sauce (different types) and great sweet tea. They have have great summer sausage, which is also my favorite. Try the  Jalapeño sausage (summer sausage and beef sausage). I've met a lot of great people standing in line waiting to order, people coming from the Governor's office, people passing by, and locals.

The line starts as you pass the ice cream and to buy the meats and take home to cook later on. Not sure that is the best place for those lines, maybe toward the exit would make sense. There was a sign that said, ""Whoa, hild your horses. Someone will call you up"". Well, someone did call me up and I had to pass a group of 4 adults who don't move out of the way or are kind enought to leave space or mayve the establishment needs to adjust the lines. So I am trying to gently and kindly plow my way through to the far end. So Levi takes my order by writing it on used receipt paper. Only 2 butches/choppers/whatever they are called so I had to wait a while. I ordered 1 pound pulled pork (good not great just good), 1 pound sausage (really good), half chicken (super good), and mac & cheese (smooth but didn't seems home made with real cheese. Not bad just had better.) They gave us a ton of roughly chopped onions (like the skin was still attached - where did these people learn their knife skills??) And a ton of spear pickles. That started to leak for my drive to Houston. Yikes! Pickle juice everywhere!As my order was being complete, the phone rang and the manager (Levi) picked up. Some had called to complain that their togo order was not complete and they forgot to put something in. The man appoligize and ask what he could do to make it up to her. I was thinking awww how nice of him, but then I thought wow, what a hassel. Especially if I didn't live close. How could he make it up to her, refund? Still someone at home (or a gathering) is going to ve pissed. Lucky for me I watched him put my order together.

Service was excellent and friendly as was on the original visit.Pig Pen BBQ ReviewJust left Pig Pen BBQ and wanted to share a review of our new small business food option. Welcome! to these folks, very nice and friendly and will no doubt be an excellent choice for additional food options in Drip(p). I placed a To Go order of 3/4 # of sliced brisket and 1/2 # of pulled pork for a total cost of $18.65.The Good:Brisket and pulled pork were both tasty albeit brisket being slightly salty. Based on taste alone, definitely worthy of a return trip. NO HINT OF BRISKET BEING SLIGHTLY SALTY THIS TIME AND TASTED EXCELLENT.The OK:Price of brisket at $16.50 per pound was a little higher than mid-range cost of comparable brisket. (comparing to $14 per pound for most awesome San Marcos BBQ and $18 per pound for decent Gordo's BBQ.)The Questionable:Only 2 slices of bread and 2 very small rolls. Kinda hard to share sammiches with family with 2 slices of bread; THE LADY ASKED ME HOW MANY PIECES OF BREAD I NEEDED THIS TIME SO I ASKED FOR 6. THE BREAD HAD A YELLOW TINT TO IT AND WAS SOFT AND RICH TASTING.Only 2 very small containers of BBQ sauce which was only enough to make a single sandwich. The sauce wasn't at all to my liking anyway; there are much better sauces available to buy at other BBQ joints and HEB. However, the brisket is plenty tasty and moist enough to not use sauce anyway; CAME WITH THREE CONTAINERS TODAY, I STILL DON'T LIKE THE SAUCE BUT DIDN'T FEEL ANY NEED TO USE IT SINCE THE MEAT WAS PERFECT.The Unacceptable:Based on the order placed of 3/4 # brisket ($12.37) and 1/2 # pulled pork ($4.75), the overall price seemed close enough including tax, however as you can see from the scales the weight came out slightly less than 3/4 # brisket which included 2 layers of paper wrapping and only a smidgeon more than 1/4 # of pulled pork which included the small styrofoam container. Even given any potential inaccuracies in my scale (excuse the decrepit appearance of my scale, it has been well used. In this case, it was calibrated to accommodate the weight of the containers), the pulled pork was definitely less weight and only provided enough meat for 1 decent sammich. All in all and given the weight of meat provided, the price of $18.65 was definitely high but I'm assuming that the charges were based on the order placed and not the actual weight of meat carved. I am now prepared to take my neighborly Facebook beating on the review  :-)","Dripping Springs, TX",73,17,1,"[7.0, 1.0, 2.0, 0.0, 7.0]",Jun-08,15,15,6,['never']

But people of any color still want to eat and hopefully this place continues to serve the needs in this community.As I approached Sam's the first look of the exterior looks old and weathered.  It sits on a corner where I had to turn and drive to enter a gravel entryway leading to an area to park. No asphalt here so your just roughing it.  Again the look from the back has serious age to it wandering how it can withstand Texas thunderstorms.  Walking past a screened patio in searching for the entrance I pulled out my phone to take lots of photos not just the sign, but the artwork on the sides of this building.  The motto here is ""You don't need no teeth to eat my beef!"".I found the entrance to find a line inside, 2 people, but waited patiently.  Meanwhile took in the proudly displayed black culture mementos of photos, art, stickers and etc.  the place was wallpapered with all of it on it. Sam's is definitely a shrine to the black community where only one person was running it.  There may have been a second person where kept seeing a man entering and leaving this place through different doors.  Some may think this neighborhood is scary or dangerous but constantly kept seeing millennials going by riding electric scooters.It was time for me to order and got the usual, brisket and pork ribs along with potato salad and macaroni & cheese as sides.  Sam runs this place barebones where will not find luxuries like AC (fans only), fancy utensils (sporks only), paper towels, and disposable plates. No alcohol is served here, but he supplies a water jug and coke machine for drinks. You will also notice a pedestal sink next to where you order to wash your hands.  The only modern day item are flat screens showing the news on one and sports on the other.  Don't gripe about the furniture where some suburbanites may remember it as something they put to the curb but this place is all about the meat. You can sit inside with the fan blowing on you, in the screen-in patio, or outside on picnic tables. Now onto the meat where it looked and smelled terrific.  The brisket was cut thick and super soft.  You do not need teeth to eat his barbecue.  It was not the usual Texas peppery flavor but more a soft broil like roast beef.  It has seasoning so it brought out good flavor.  Next was the pork ribs which basically same softness and just fell off the bone.  So soft you could slurp it down like oysters. The potato salad was very tasty along with the macaroni & cheese.We enjoyed the bbq and atmosphere, and definitely return for more bbq.","Austin, TX",218,654,4119,"[346.0, 210.0, 85.0, 11.0, 2.0]",May-12,1425,455,1246,"['Elite 2021', '’20', '’19', '’18', '’17', '’16', '’15', '’14', '’13', '’12']"

Don t let that scare you.  The bbq is stellar and the owners very friendly.Sam's is unique and famous for its smoked mutton--a rarity in these parts.  My mutton ribs were unctuous, well spiced with bark, perfectly cooked, and needed no sauce.   Sliced brisket was moist, tender, and served with a side of vinegary, not overly sweet, spiced red sauce that I would drink by the pint.  Nice bark, nice smoke ring, expertly done.  Sides were beans and potato salad, both fine.  The storefront is a throwback to much earlier times--walls full of browning old photos, water cooler to the right of the counter (Sam's has no liquor license), bathroom sink for hand washing to the left. A few booths and tables in the counter area, with more tables in a side room.  The facade out front says, ""You don't need no teeth to eat my beef.""  Very true.  Good pick-up line, as well.In some respects, Sam's was my favorite bbq joint of this trip. The owner was offered $5million  by a real estate developer for the property.  Sam's owner told them to go scratch.  Don't miss a chance to eat here while you can.  I hope it stays around for many return visits.","Beaverton, OR",1,34,48,"[7.0, 21.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]",Apr-10,40,6,8,['never']

There are places to sit, you get to breath that good Texas air, and you get to chow down on beautifully cooked food.

Southside BBQ once a legendary establishment that created the legend of Elgin sausage - is now merely utility stuffI am talking about amazing Central Texas meat, with a taste so powerful you need zero sauce.Benny's Texas BBQ is the real deal.They may have the best sausage I have had in Texas - although I would need to revisit a few legendary establishments once or twice more just to re-calibrate my ratings.Certainly Benny's sausage is in the All-Texas top 3 or 4.Their angle - which is a good one - is to go for the texture of a frankfurt or a knockwurst. Slow down here before you blurt out ""I don't want a hot dog! I want barbecue!"".The advantage of a frankfurt over a Texas Sausage is that it is packed more tightly.So you get more meat in your sausage and less air and less filler.Too much Texas sausage is space between the meat.If your sausage crumbles, it is packed way too loose and that happens a lot around here.But a well textured sausage is not enough to make you Texas BBQ.Otherwise, Oscar Mayer would be a champion.But to make it Central Texas BBQ, the smoking has to be perfect, the meat itself has to be excellent and the spicing has to be on target.Does Benny's have the big three?Yes, yes and yes.My Benny's sausage had an ultra-powerful basso profundo smoke that gave you that great dark taste as soon as you put the sausage in your mouth -and stayed in my mouth for easily an hour after I got back on the highway.Benny's is spot on with the black pepper. Many Texas sausages (Snook sausage - I am talking to you here) put vast amounts of black pepper into the sausage - which kills the taste of the meat and gives a burn that is unpleasant rather than tasty. At Benny's there is enough salt and pepper to give the meat zing but none of the silly Czech sausage excesses.The management at Benny's likes to put a mild BBQ sauce on the sausage, and ballpark mustard.Ballpark mustard??? goes this reviewer.Trust management here. The combo of mild sauce and ballpark yellow lightens up the taste of the dark rich meat but detracts zero from the fundamental taste of the beef.(Contrast this with the hide a million sins bbq sauces in Elgin.)Benny's is on the side of 71 on the way to Austin and gets a lot of commuters going West in the AM.So they have a thriving breakfast taco business as well as traditional BBQ.They also do a homemade chocolate banana pudding.What's not to like????","Austin, TX",1,41,0,"[11.0, 15.0, 5.0, 8.0, 2.0]",Sep-09,24,5,1,['never']

I had to hold it with my hand wide open so one taco per person is ample! The cooked-right-in-front-of-you eggs picked up the flavors of the potatoes which were nice and soft. Perfection! The salsa is hot (spicy) and flavorful. The brisket taco was packed with meat and topped with a little pico. This isn't a normal breakfast taco offering so I'd choose something different next time.

So, had that been all, I would have given it 4-5 stars.We went by today because I wanted to try the chopped beef brisket. I have to say it was the worst I have ever tasted.Unlike most chopped sandwiches, this was delivered, to go, in a container vs wrapped in something so it was not squished. That gave them a star. The entire time we waited, it did not smell like someone was smoking meat, it smelled like someone was burning already burnt meat. The acidic smoke smell was so strong, it was not pleasing in the slightest. No big deal, we were getting it to go.When I looked at the chopped beef burger, (sorry, I did not take a picture..I may need to go try it again as I cannot believe they can be that bad and will update this if I do go back)...it looked like a dark red..whatever.. ..ground beef? Hard to explain. The meat was so soft, almost as if it was the gristle more than the brisket it should have been. The entire thing was as acidic as the smell we had smelled. I had to try a couple bites of the ""meat"" without the pickles and onions and bread to see if what I was tasting was real.The ""meat"" had zero flavor outside of the acidic smoke flavor. It was as if they had taken the briskets and scrapped the rub off and made a sandwich out of the scrapings. In neither bite, could I catch a hint of meat.BBQ should be flavored by everything you add.. enhanced....it is the meat with additives. This.. this was all the left over additives, no meat.Again, their ribs, the time I went, were really good, but today... totally not impressed.","Round Rock, TX",361,55,76,"[25.0, 8.0, 6.0, 8.0, 8.0]",Sep-10,89,36,12,['never']

Any questions or changes needed on the quote, they were on top of anything we needed. The day of the event, they arrived early as they said they would and set up quickly. The aroma of the food was wonderful throughout our venue. We had a handful of vegetarian/vegan employees and the offer a smoked vegetable tray with corn tortillas as one of their options.The food we chose was a 3 meat plate with 3 sides and cookies for the dessert. We chose Brisket, Turkey and Sausage. For the sides, we had Gouda Mac and Cheese, Creamed Corn and Beans.Everything was extremely delicious and the feedback I gathered from numerous employees was nothing but positive reviews on the food.

I got my order, put a few pickles on top and some of their BBQ sauce and headed back to my office. The sandwich was HUGE so I cut it in half with a plastic knife. The brisket slices, about 1/2"" thick, cut like butter. The bun was sweet. The pickles were perfect. The sauce is my new favorite. This was the best brisket sandwich I've ever had and I'm a patron of Elgin and Lockhart BBQ. The smoke ring was beautiful, the (lean) brisket was unbelievably tender and flavorful. One of my co-workers ordered a pulled pork sandwich with slaw and absolutely raved about it. Another ordered their Gouda Mac & Cheese and was an instant fan.

That was odd since it only takes a couple minutes, at most, to put together a chopped brisket sandwich.After about 10 minutes in my car, the gentleman at the counter walked out and apologized that ""they got to talking and it will be a few more minutes"". It took another 5 minutes. Fifteen minutes to receive a chopped brisket sandwich is unacceptable, but I would have overlooked it if the food was good. It was not.The brisket was soaked in sauce and had grilled onions in it (I had asked for no onions). There was some smoke flavor, but it basically tasted like the BBQ you buy in the bucket at Sam's club but a little worse. I think this was done in an oven with liquid smoke. There were several pieces in the brisket that were so hard and overcooked that I couldn't chew them. That was a first for a chopped brisket sandwich. Also, the sandwich wasn't even lukewarm and it takes me 5 minutes to drive from the restaurant back to work and get to my office.This is the second time I've tried this place and the food isn't good. It's not a 4.5 star restaurant - not even close. I think people just don't know what good barbecue tastes like or the reviews on here are friends and family of the owner.Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.The one star is because the food and the service were so bad.

The slaw was very good and a different taste than I have had. It was able to impress my wife who's from KY and very particular about her coleslaw. The red beans and rice was unique. The sausage was good I guess it might be great for someone who loves bbq sausage. I generally don't like sausage but this was good as well. The spicy bbq sauce was awesome I loved it. I used it even on my red beans and rice. They offer hot dogs and bake potatoes w bbq meat on them as well. They sell by the pound and I saw they had a special on turkey legs and corn bread that day. While the restaurant was small the tastes were bold and my wife and I really had a great time. We will visit again and I wish we lived closer.

They said they didn't have any potatoes. Whew...I am glad, because I don't think they should serve a microwaved potato. We all should know a baked tater should take about an hour in the oven.The food overall wasn't too bad, but it's not high on the list of places I would rush back to.The sides were a disappointment. The cole slaw was chopped differently and also tasted differently. It grew on me after each bite, but it wasn't something I would get again.The Mac n cheese looked really dry. The potato salad wasn't bad.Ribs were ok, not terrible. Brisket was ok and really lacked the smoke ring. Pulled pork was dry. Bbq sauce wasn't bad. My son said ""a little goes a long way"". I would rate that the bbq sauce was the best part of the meal, followed by the ribs and potato salad tying, then brisket. The rest was meh.Serving size was pretty good. Got 3 slices of brisket and like a fist size scoop of pulled pork. 1lb of ribs was 4 ribs.I hope it was just a bad night and normally their food is fresher.

Desserts are also typical for Texas, including pecan pie and seasonal cobbler. The meat eaters in our party loved the chicken, brisket, and ribs. Iced tea is a staple here (as in all of Texas), as are a roster of cold beers, including regional and national brews.

There's also waiter service.  Further, the menu has a variety of side orders and a huge variety of other foods, including burgers and chicken fried steak. Unlike a lot of the newer BBQ options in Austin, walking into Green Mesquite doesn't feel like you've walked directly into the pit itself.Food?  Damned good.  Mom and I each tried an order of baby back ribs since they have a weekend special for a half rack and two sides for $10.99.  The ribs were cooked to perfection with a slight glaze.  Not too messy and not too sweet either.  Also, they're cooked long enough so as not to leave an overly pork-y flavor in your mouth.  Both my fries and my mac and cheese were very good.  In fact, they were significantly better than they looked.  The sauce is one of my favorites.  The sauce is a perfect mix of sweet with a hint of vinegar.  It flows perfectly out of the squeeze bottle on the table. I would also be remiss if I didn't mention our appetizer of hush puppies, which were superior to most any seafood restaurant and came right out the fryer piping hot.As good as the food was, the service was even better. Our waiter was friendly, made great (and not forced) conversation with us about the food, kept the drinks refilled, and genuinely thanked us several times for our business.Long story short.  If you want BBQ, other options, and excellent service, you should give Green Mesquite a chance.  Or you can wait in line.","Austin, TX",231,33,1,"[18.0, 7.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.0]",Feb-11,43,17,22,['never']

I have to say that Keith's easily fits into my top 5. Everything I have had there so far is excellent from the meat to the sweet and creamy coleslaw. I was particularly impressed with the moistness and humongousness of the pulled pork sandwich, and I am in fact still sitting here dreaming about it now as I type this review.The service is top-notch and friendly and they provide the additional benefit of being able to text in your order to speed up the process.

The crowd was an eclectic mix of people (Caucasian, Hispanic, Black, and various folks of Asian descent). I think it was predominantly people looking for excellent food.  I spoke with multiple wait staff and they all spoke with understandable accented English. Much better than my one word of Chinese.  XieXie roughly pronounced in English as 'she she'.   The menu is in Mandarin but it has English translations for those who speak only a single language like myself.  Staff was super friendly and answered multiple questions that I had as different dishes pasted by headed to other tables. The acoustics of the restaurant are much best than most places were the collective voices turn into a loud sensory loading mummer.  Even with all the table full, we were able to carry on a normal conversation.  Pretty nice. We ordered the seaweed salad, pig leg, short ribs, and bacon wrapped mushrooms.  All the items were on the table in less than 15 minutes.  Presentation of each dish was very nice.  I can state the seaweed salad was the best I have ever had.  Perfect blend of flavors, mild spice, and textures. The pig leg (the menu is very direct in interpretation. I would call it the Pork Delight Plate or something else folksy) was well presented. It's a cool plate of thinly cross sliced pork leg. Very tender with lots of mild flavors.  Its a perfect appetizer or can be part of a main meal. I have never encountered mushrooms wrapped in bacon. They take small bunches of straw mushrooms, wrap with bacon, then broil. WARNING: they are extremely HOT when they come to the table. Let them cool off a bit and I suggest you cut them with knife and fork.  Delicate and delicious.  The short ribs were well marinated and broiled.  The dish comes with steamed rice. Nice caramelization.  Very good.   Full mean for two people plus some leftovers for $30.  We already have the next visit planned.  Seaweed salad, lamb kabobs, and chicken katsu.

From the time we placed the order at the counter, it literally took 37 minutes. My husband was furious when a family just came in to dine and there food was brought out before our order and he had been waiting a long time already! Their excuse was the grilled bass takes a long time to cook. That's baloney!! Grilled bass cooks very quickly so that's nonsense. At least apologize and take something off our bill for the inconvenience and inordinate amount of time sitting around waiting for our food when you didn't have operation together. You poorly prioritized how the orders came out. We ordered beef, chicken, lamb, shrimp and squid skewers. All skewers were overcooked and on the dry side. Squid was not on skewers but in loose pieces in the to go container. The grilled shrimp  was the tastiest but there was only one single shrimp on the skewer - for real! Seasoning was good but because the meat was too dry, it took away from the overall taste. Grilled bass was cooked well but had too many small bones we couldn't eat half of it! Grilled bass also needs some sauce or lemon wedges to accompany it because otherwise it didn't have much flavor. I pulled out pre-made seasoned Vietnamese fish sauce that I had in my fridge. Otherwise, why order a dry cold grilled bass fish with tons of tiny bones?? No, will not order the bass again. Also would not order the grilled eggplant again. It was entirely a sloppy slimy goopy soggy clump by the time it got home. Based on our first and only experience with take out at TLLT, I would steer you away from take out orders unless they better manage their operations.  This is the former Mama Fu's location but they've walled off the right side where the strip of booths were (not sure what that space is being used for now) so the interior dining space is smaller. There are a couple wait staff who take your order if you dine in. Also the individual skewers while reasonably priced come with nothing so I reheated some steamed rice and sauteed snow peas I had in my fridge to eat with our order. Beware of the long wait times for take out!!","Austin, TX",3,19,9,"[11.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 6.0]",Feb-11,35,4,9,['never']

The menu is a giant picture book to let non-Asian patrons know what is served. TLLT grills just about every part of the animal's body, from the rooter to the tooter. If you want pigs feet. They got it. If you're hankering for lamb testicles. They got it. Seaweed pickled in ginger, they got that too - which is fabulous, BTW! I went basic with chicken wings, chicken kabob, and a plate of fried rice. The technique to their grilling is kabob style, and that's how it is served. I gotta tell ya, that chicken was amazing!

Not too shabby!Service:  The service was fast and it is only counter service.  They do have tables inside but, I just ordered take out.  I believe this may have been the family that owns the place working there but, not sure.  They gave me ample napkins and silverware so, it's nice to see that they don't forget anything.Parking:  Sort of a nightmare since there is a convenience store attached to it.  I am pretty sure that I parked illegally however, I was in and out.  It was easy to get in and out of the parking lot here though; not too much traffic.Neighborhood:  Not that great and I did see a man pushing a lawn mower down the sidewalk.  Sort of the same principal of knowing you are in a bad neighborhood by how many abandoned shopping carts their are!  Come during the day!","New Orleans, LA",39,45,14,"[16.0, 13.0, 5.0, 6.0, 5.0]",May-11,43,10,6,['never']

Sam's Bar-B-Cue was one of them and the other was Willie's Bar-B-Que. I recently had the boudin sausage from Willie's and wanted some more of it. Willie's shares space with a barbershop and a gas station so you could easily miss it as you drive by.You can only order the meat by the half pound so I went with a three-meat plate that is not listed on the menu. The plate came with moist brisket, pork ribs, and Elgin sausage with sides of potato salad and beans. I also added a link of boudin sausage. When I got my food, I looked down and saw a lot of the meats covered in barbecue sauce and seasoned salt. I thought that was a weird touch. The brisket was thinly sliced into small rectangular cuts. I did find an unscathed piece from the sauce and salt. The brisket tasted like smoky roast beef. There was not a whole lot of flavor so the seasoning salt and sauce did come in handy. The ribs were gray on the outside and pink on the inside. It was void of any flavor. Without the pink, I would have guessed the ribs were cooked in an oven the day before. The meat was tender and coming off the bone. The sausage had a nice spicy bite, but the casing was really chewy. It was beefy and a good amount of fat. The smoked boudin was definitely the highlight. The casing was snappy and could barely hold in the filling. The richness of the sausage played nice with the Cajun spices. I would have liked to see a little bit more meat in it because it was very heavy on the rice. There was nothing to note about the sides. Plain, bland, and probably store bought.I do not know if I could trust a restaurant that would buy stolen meat. The word quality comes to mind. If you are taking a chance on your main product, what else are you willing to do? Willie's smoked boudin was solid, but I would rather go to Smokey Denmark for that.","Austin, TX",8,4,0,"[1.0, 2.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]",Sep-12,4,1,1,['never']

Mac cheese: tasted like flour, pasta way over cooked, it was an odd burn flour looking color, tasted like nothing, and was gritty???Creamed corn: it wasnt creamy at all, it looked like corn tossed in flour and milk, color was of sand Fries: same exact thing!! I can go into the freezer aisle and find any fries and cook it myself. It tasted the same exact way. Usually fries have salt on them, this was cooked and thrown into the take away box.The desserts were the nail in the coffin. We cried when they were tasted. The banana pudding was milk like, the whipped cream was the common canned whipped cream that you can buy at the store. (It was a liquid when we got it) the oreo pie tasted like stale oreos, no cream cheese, and whipped cream. Chocolate cake felt like we were eating a dry block of chocolate and tons of raw sugar. The best part? All 3 of us were sick when we woke up. Beware of this restaurant people... take your money elsewhere.","Austin, TX",0,21,1,"[12.0, 1.0, 0.0, 2.0, 6.0]",Nov-14,46,7,14,['never']

(As other Yelpers have noted, the BBQ is cut and prepared in a back kitchen.)  The brisket was a real let down from the typical high quality brisket you see at most BBQ purveyors in Austin.  The meat was poorly cut.  More importantly, the brisket didn't taste good -- whether it was the lack of bark, the lack of smoke or pepper, or maybe needing more time in the pit to let the fat properly render, this brisket wasn't ready for prime time.  And one other kitchen flub -- we never got the fries we ordered.  I mentioned this when the food was brought out and there was a promise to return with fries.  And again, before we finished our meal, I asked about the fries.  The kitchen staff claimed ignorance again.  The gentleman at the counter was gracious, removed the charge, and surmised that somehow the order for the fries was never transmitted to the kitchen.  Perhaps so, although the amount of people waiting for orders, especially to-go orders, indicated that there might be a bigger problem with the team in the kitchen.Between this and some other glitches, it's clear that the folks at Oakwood want to provide good BBQ and good service -- but they're not there yet.  Like so many BBQ places, good BBQ can only carry you so far -- the service and the rest of the experience has to be on point too.","Austin, TX",0,5,2,"[3.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0]",Jun-16,0,0,0,['never']

The setup of the restaurant is really surprising as you order what you like at the counter and the server brings you whatever food you've ordered. So you pay right when you get in and the hostess kindly directs you to your table. All drinks and refreshments minus alcohol can be found on the far right of the restaurant for you to serve yourself, along with any to go boxes.We ended up ordering the braised beef jjim as well as the seafood pancheon which were both equally delicious in their own unique ways. The braised beef jjim was the right amount of sweet and salty and super tender. The vegetables perfectly accent the dish ( potatoes, shisitos, carrots, onions, and some hidden mushrooms). As for the seafood pancheon it's not your typical seafood pancake but the chef didn't skimp on the seafood!! The flakiness of the batter is an improvement from a normal Korean seafood pancake, in my opinion!! One last thing I forgot to mention was that the kimchi reminded me of my moms kimchi and the use of pears was a nice addition. Jjim is a bit pricey but I really like how they build the tip into the menu to pay their staff a better wage.

I've been here twice and both times were great experiences with fantastic service and delicious food.Upon entering, you're greeted warmly and see a counter directly to the left and a wall of their merchandise and drinks to the right. After you order at the counter, the friendly staff take you to a seat - there's both plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. The place feels that much more spacious with its high ceilings and largely windowed walls. There was also a wall adorned with framed pictures of tigers, including a Tiger Woods picture which I found humorous. There is an area in the back where you can fill up on drinks if you ordered one, and grab utensils and things, although the service staff are also on point about bringing you what you need.I ordered the seafood pancake both times which is a testament to how much I enjoyed it. While unorthodox for a Korean pancake, I love the crunchy texture and the perfect ratio between veggies, seafood, and batter.I also ordered their jjim both times because duh, that's what they're known for! It was so exciting each time to see them bring out the beautiful cast iron pan of steaming meat and colorful veggies. I tried the beef short rib and oxtail and both were so flavorful and tender, with the oxtail being (arguably) slightly more tender. Their veggies are perfectly cooked and while not the star, do well to support the dish and serve as vessels of the heavenly juices that pool at the bottom of the pan. Side note, I highly recommend spooning some of those juices over your rice. Speaking of rice, let's not forget the sides - along with the jjim, they provide a nice-sized, covered bowl of rice that you can share. As someone who loves her rice, I can appreciate the plentiful portion and the ability to get more while staying warm under its cover. The jjim also comes with a choice of add-ons, and each time I opted for kimchi and pickles. They have my favorite kimchi because it has pieces of pear(?) mixed in which gives an additional texture and lovely sweetness that appeals to my sweet tooth while balancing with other flavors.I got the medium size jjim each time which I found to be perfect for 2, although they list it as good for 2-3 guests. If you're aiming to share between 3 people, you might want to order other dishes. If you don't finish your food, they say that the jjim are great as leftovers and have to-go containers at the ready.Small but admirable detail: they have a no tipping policy. Signs on their counter inform you of their belief that they should already compensate their staff well enough to not need tips.I have not been for them but they do have alcohol specials through happy hour and things like wine Wednesdays.

Careful when you're ordering drinks -- prices aren't listed and there are some expensive bottles of sake! But, they do have 50% off sake night I believe on Wednesdays, which would definitely be worth it!For a table of four we ordered the Yellowtail Ceviche, Large Beef Short Rib Jjim (with kimchi and pickles), and the Seafood Pancake Jeon. This was plenty for four with some leftover! Everything was absolutely delicious. Do not come here and not order the Jjim -- it is a MUST! The ceviche was also fantastic, thinly sliced and super fresh. My mouth is watering thinking about it! The pancake was good, but super thick and honestly I would skip it in the future. More room for the Jjim! Delicious sauce, thick chunks of meat and veggies.Two reasons why this is a 4 star review rather than 5. 1) Unlike traditional Korean BBQ, you only get a choice of one side.

The meats on both beef and pork were fall off the bone. The noodles perfect al dente chewy texture meanwhile the cheese is not an overwhelming smother. Extremely flavorful as the sauce was perfect to pour over rice. You can tell that it took some time to make it that tender. There's not much of a benchmark in Austin for this dish so I think it'll be popular and catch on. Chosun Galbi is another option. They and all in California that I've experienced are more saucy versions. This is a lighter but doesn't mean it's bad, just a different presentation. Price is the same as Cali though. It does come with shareable rice, kim chi and pickles side dish. $55 for 2-3 and $75 for 3-4 however, important to note that they don't do any tipping.

I went to Korea 2 years ago and had my first jjim dishes there, which were magnificent. So I've been wanting to eat here ever since I heard it was opening. I finally had the opportunity, but we ordered to go instead of dining there as we had a rather large family gathering. I knew the three jjim dishes were meant to feed 2-3 people so I thought the price was very reasonable, especially when you're sharing one of the jjims. The price was also very similar to how much it was when I was in Korea. We picked up our order and it took us around 25 minutes to get the food home and it was still delicious!I have to first mention the kimchi! It is WONDERFUL! There are pear slices in the kimchi so the mix of spicy and sweet was just perfect. I could not stop eating it.For the appetizer we ordered the Seafood Pancake. This is not your normal seafood pancake. It is more tempura battered and crispy to perfection! It was still very crispy when we got home and it was one of my faves of the meal.For the entrees we ordered the Beef Short Rib, Oxtail and Spicy Pork Jjims. All 3 were so tender and full of flavor. I think my favorite of the three was the oxtail. We had some leftover and I had it the next day. It was just as good as the first day! Our add-on was the Egg Jjim which I would recommend in a heartbeat. It's like an egg souffle and I had seconds and thirds. I usually cannot eat too much eggs but this was was not overwhelming for me. We also ordered the Spicy Pork Belly Bulgogi and the Japchae. You really can't go wrong with either of these items.

The meat was so delectably tender. I wish the potatoes and carrots were a little softer and stewed a bit more and more flavorful, but the all the veggies were delicious as well! I also wish there was more sauce for the rice. Maybe that's a takeout thing. We added cheese which, even though it tasted good, I don't think it goes as well with the takeout order because it gets a bit cold and gummy. I DID love the addition of glass noodles. They were thicker than I expected but they soaked up the sauce so perfectly and maintained their chew. You must order this dish!KIMCHI PANCAKE - SO CRISP. So delicious! I was craving a pancake - next time I will for sure try the seafood one too! I was worried it would get soggy on the drive home but it was still super crispy when we ate. It had everything you want in a kimchi pancake - a tangy and savory flavor, crispy thin edges, a light and airy batter. Plus, it was huge, but I couldn't stop munching. The only thing I could say is more sauce please!FRIED SHRIMP MANDU - now I liked this dish but it was interesting. I'd probably only order if I were craving this specific type of dish. I was expecting the shrimp to be pasty and minced but it was  a whole piece of shrimp wrapped in a dumpling wrapper and deep fried which tasted good, it was just not what I was expecting.We ordered online and chose to pay in person. We parked in the garage (luckily we found parking on the first floor) and went inside to pick up. Honestly, this really should be eaten in a group. It was just me and my boyfriend. We had a bit of leftovers at the end but less so than I was expecting at the price! It's still totally worth it. I really can't wait for it to be safer to eat in person with friends because I will definitely be dining here!

Jjim has been one of the most anticipated restaurant opening for me and it did not disappoint at all.   As a Korean American,  braised beef is one of my favorite dish, EVER.  Braised beef is generally served as the main dish at Korean weddings and special events so it's definitely a special dish to appreciate.  Once you try it, you'll see Korean BBQ in a whole new way.   Having been raised in Los Angeles, equivalent dish would easily cost 30-40% more so Jjim is providing their braised beef at more than reasonable price, especially when you can share with your party.  Seriously, to have a place in Austin that specializes this particular dish is a huge deal. The beef was soooo tender, you won't need to grab a knife at all. (funny, they actually provide you a butter knife)  The perfect balance between the salty and sweet of the beef will delight you along with the mushroom, onions and potatoes to balance things out.  Oh and the cheese add-on is a must IMO.  Jjim is a must try for all.  Staff is amazingly friendly and my food came out quickly.  I love how Jjim captured traditional korean tiger folk tale in their overall design.  Definitely a nice touch.  I'm sure you'll end up introducing all your friends to Jjim once you've tried it.  I only wish there was one closer to where I am near Cedar Park but the drive is definitely worth it!!","Austin, TX",270,88,24,"[44.0, 25.0, 10.0, 4.0, 5.0]",Jan-08,261,114,152,['never']

They distinguish themselves by offering delicious jjim.What is jjim? Jjim is a Korean dish that takes meat, marinates it in sauce, puts it to a boil, and then reducing the liquid - adding veggies to enhance the flavor.The one I got was the Beef Short Rib Jjim which also comes with potatoes, carrots, shishito peppers, mushrooms, shallots, and chives. This one is marinated in a sweet soy based sauce!I gotta say, this was probably the best beef short rib I've had. Very flavorful - has a nice rich taste that isn't overpowering. A good contrast of a chewy outter texture with a tender texture on the inside. Outstanding! Additionally, I added flat glass noodles for $4 extra and although they were good, I felt I could have done without since they already come with white rice!I enjoyed the atmosphere as it strives for a mix between modern and antique. They are a no tipping restaurant, so what you see is what you pay! All in all, I had a great experience here.If I had to give some constructive feedback, I'd say that I felt the dish was rather small.

But pretty disappointed on several levels.First - the service model is odd. You order at the counter, which is fine. But why is my cashier also responsible for the drinks as well as seating me? It just causes a huge bottleneck at the cash register. She also didn't seem to worry if I had a reservation or not (didn't even ask until I mentioned it). Food - all of our food (kalbi jjim, kim chi pancake, even the rice) came out lukewarm/room temp). If you've ever eaten at Sun Nong Dan, the jjim comes out in a massive, bubbling hot cauldron. The food here came out in a cast iron skillet with a handle cover for the heat, but I could have grabbed the whole thing with both hands and had no problems. Kind of off putting. The flavor of the food was fine, but it would have been much better if it was actually hot. Other nitpicks:-$5 dollars for kim chi? I've never been to a Korean place that charges you for banchan. Come on. I'm already paying $55 for the jjim. -They have a sign saying they are a no-tip establishment so they can pay their employees a living wage, which I totally support. But even if they did allow tips, what would I be tipping for? It was counter service, and aside from them bringing out my food, no one ever came back to check to see if we needed anything once. They just said ""if you need anything come back to the counter."" The service model makes this place feel like a fast casual restaurant. But then you realize you're paying $100 for a meal for two people (between an entree, appetizer, and two drinks). It feels like if I paid $100 at a Chipotle.

The ""no tip"" business model will also mean the food will be a little pricer than what you would pay at most Korean restaurants, but we love to see restaurants who give their employees fair wages.The ordering experience wasn't the best. I disliked how I wasn't able to pay online, so I couldn't just grab my food and leave ASAP. I also wish the site had more pictures of the food since their gallery was pretty limited. (As of 3/6/2021 anyway) The restaurant had a cool vibe. The front end staff seemed to be pretty stressed out with the small crowd towards the front, so that wasn't super ideal, but I'm sure they're still in the process of working out the kinks.What I Ordered (To-Go): Medium Braised Ox Tail: great portion for two people. The marination was rich, sweet n savory. I usually hate onions but the caramelized onions were *chef's kiss*. And the mushrooms at the end after it's been soaking in the marination??? AMAZING. Try to eat the meat while it's warm. When it gets cold, it tastes a lil salty  (5 stars) Kimchi Pancake: more like kimchi fritters if anything, but they were definitely crunchy after the 35 min trek home. (5 stars)Asian Pear Colada: for some reason, I wasn't expecting coconut, but that's what ""Colada"" implies. First sip, it did kind of taste like korean golden pears with a hint of coconut but as it melted (def my fault. I was too focused on the main course) it tasted like sweet sake with a hint of coconut.

So Milt's is charging more than Franklin, and while the brisket is good, it is not even on the same planet as Franklin and a few other well-known places. And if you are interested, $34 a pound is about what a lobe of foie gras costs.Along with living in pandemic conditions, we are now seeing barbecue price gouging, as we do at the pump during ""fuel crises."" In fact, the availability and price of brisket has come down in recent weeks, but Milt's is one of several places that seems to be exploiting the actual shortage, even as it eases. I had a Lockhart sausage which was $4.99. OK, fair enough. Ordered a brisket sandwich for 11.99 which consisted of three very good but not great slices of brisket. But $17.00 for a HALF pound of brisket? At a good but not great place in Kyle? The sauce, which I always ask for on the side, tasted like commercial sauce with artificial smoke flavoring added.

Nothing memorable or special about Milt's Pit BBQ, except maybe that it is one of the limited eateries to choose from in Kyle, TX. Quick takeout order. The hubby and I can usually split a multi-meat plate. Opted for the ""Big Man Binge"" bbq plate - sounded promising. Came with brisket, ribs, sausage, two sides of choice, and a medium drink for $15.99. Not a lot of bang for your buck...and, yes, I'm accustomed to dishing out the $$$ for good Q. Included: A few thin slices of on-the-dry side brisket. Certainly not ""fatty"" (a.k.a. moist) brisket. Lacked any depth of flavor and that crust that makes brisket so wonderful. A couple of small ribs, tender, fall off the bone; however, again, on the bland side. One link sausage, sliced, good sear, actually liked it, even though sausage isn't usually my fav. Other reviewers raved about Milt's beans, but failed to state green or bbq so decided to get each. Super duper small sides; beans were beans were beans. Huh? To go container/bag had one little sad piece of bread in it, no Texas obligatory sliced white onions, only one pathetic dill chip, and no sauce - which I usually forego (good Q doesn't need it and it's actually considered sacrilege [in Texas anyway], like putting A1 on a prime ribeye); however, this Q could've used a lil ""help."" Sadly, I doubt I'll be a repeat offender when/if in Kyle...unless maybe for a burger from the ""Grill"" as several others have suggested. ""There's your sign!""

The first night of the event I had the chicken sliders which is a catering menu item. The chicken was well seasoned topped with magic sauce. The hint of spice, toppings and soft bun were perfect. The second night I had their freaking amazing beef street taco. When I indulge I want it to be amazing and their streeet tacos were oh so worth it. The rib eye bulgogi was rich and flavorful. The cilantro, onions, Chi'Lantro salsa, sesame seeds, and lime wedge and fresh corn tortillas complimented the meat perfectly.They also serve tofu as a protein option and they have some gluten free menu items. Chi'Lantro is known for their gorgeous original kimchi fries and for a first time visit these are a must. The fries come with your choice of ribeye bulgogi, spicy pork, spicy chicken, soy glazed chicken or marinated tofu, then topped with caramelized kimchi, cheddar & Monterey jack cheese, onions, fresh cilantro, spicy magic sauce, sesame seeds and sriracha.Last night I finally tried their brick and mortar on South Lamar, review to follow!","Austin, TX",899,1119,4515,"[504.0, 456.0, 114.0, 38.0, 7.0]",Feb-09,13352,6196,11157,"['Elite 2021', '’20', '’19', '’18', '’17', '’16', '’15', '’14', '’13', '’12', '\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 more year as an Elite\n\n']"

I first read about their Original Kimchi Fries in the local newspaper which questioned whether or not their fries were overrated. Chi'Lantro built its empire on their amazing Original Kimchi Fries, Korean Fried Chicken Wings with gangnam sauce and other Korean-Mexican inspired dishes. So despite what the newspaper said, I had to try the Original Kimchi Fries that transformed a food truck into multiple brick-and-mortar stores. The Kimchi Fries were a masterpiece of flavor and texture. The kimchi was buried under the fries and sauce, but it provided an incredible burst of umami or savoriness to the fries. It's characteristic sour flavor left your mouth watering and craving for the next bite. The Korean chili powder wasn't too overwhelming to the point where there was too much heat either. It was just the right amount of chili powder for the flavor. The fries themselves were crispy and golden on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. Combined with the sharp cheeses (Monterey Jack + Cheddar), some magic sauce, a dash of sriracha (after all, how can you be trendy without it?) and topped with cilantro, the Kimchi Fries was a blast. My only gripe was that the tofu was fried to an absolute crisp. It was way too crunchy and way too much fried flour for the tofu. Even though Chi'Lantro is fast food, the depth of flavor belies the amount of time spent preparing it. It is on the slightly higher end of the price spectrum, but that is to be expected. I think it was completely worth it to pay the premium for the ingredients and the ingenuity. Chi'Lantro challenges the way you envision traditional Korean cuisine (Korean BBQ) and is infused with lively Mexican flavors.

The sides here unlike most BBQ places are ALL amazing and tbh taste even better than homemade (didn't think that would be possible!)

Ordered a couple off the less-common items in Texas BBQ - the half Cornish Game Hen and the Beef Ribs, with a side of corn and beans.  Both were cooked to tender fork-ability, and the Game Hen had a nice smoke flavor all through the meat. The beef ribs were a surprise - unlike the Fred Flintstone style brontosaurus ribs, these are more like Asian short ribs.  Seasoning is a little puzzling, there's some sweet and herbal notes - maybe even sesame! - that I haven't come across in other Texas BBQ.  To my palate it seems a little more Middle Eastern or even Asian.The corn is unremarkable, but props for the beans.  Again, a surprise.  Rather than a typical BBQ bean, these are more sweet and sticky, like a serving of Boston Baked Beans.  I'd eat these alone or with a hot dog on a cold winter morning and love it!This place scores a 4 out of 5 on the 'CTJ Scale', as noted below.5 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Jesus good.

We usually pick up or eat here(precovid), but as a family with 5 young kids, we decided to order through DoorDash because it's not always convenient packing the 5 of them up to take out if 1 parent is at work... SO HAPPY WE DID! It was all neatly and tightly packaged so that nothing would fall over. I've had bad experiences with other places (EX:MFBurger) not packing well and sauce spilling all over bags and juices of meats dripping all over..just plain messes. So, Alzer's was an extreme relief with their over the top excellent packaging! Sorry, enough about the packaging.. onto the food! Absolutely perfect as always! They have halal chicken, brisket, and lamb so we opt for those for some clean good meats. We love all 3, but the chicken and brisket seem to go fastest.

It has over a hundred congratulatory signatures.Next to it is a commemorative declaration from the State of Texas, signed by Rick Perry - who then was governor.There is a burnt orange banner commemorating the forty-fifth anniversary of Bert's Bar-B-Q.There is a photo of the Clock Tower in Orange Lights and Number One on the side.There are no fewer than eighteen stuffed deer heads or antlers on the walls. The wall also has the original photos of the deer being displayed after being bagged, along with fishers showing off some really huge fish.Nearly everyone in the restaurant dates from the era of these pictures..Not counting the help, only one person in the store was younger than forty years old.*But time passes, and barbecue in Austin is a lot better today than it used to be forty years ago.The old classic places are being run by people who are not as good as their parents, grandparents or former employers. Mueller's, Southside BBQ and the former Lockhart establishments are shadows of their former selves.The new pitmaster-supremes are twenty-five to forty years old - are working in food trailers  on the East Side - and are blowing people away with what they can do to meat.*Bert's sadly has been left in the dust.

The beans were tasteless, the potato salad supermarket quality.They do offer whole wheat bread as an option - and that is good for soaking up their sauce.The BBQ sauce still has the fire and tang.However, let's not go too far in sending Bert's Bar-B-Q to premature retirement.There were about fifteen people in there when I was eating - and they had clearly come to Bert;s because Bert's is where they wanted to be.Most were silver hairs who would never think of waiting three hours for a sausage link at Franklin's but want good BBQ close to their Mesa-area homes.*And Texas BBQ is still Texas BBQ.There is only one Texas in the USA, and the BBQ here is like BBQ no where else on Earth.Even just ok Texas BBQ is a privilege to have.If this place were in Wisconsin, I would be eating at Bert's a couple of times a week.(Wisconsin food can be really boring. Texas food rarely is.)So Bert's is still maintaining a great Lone Star tradition.And you look at the walls (or the customers) and you feel tied in to an earlier time when Austin was a magical place, but it was a different kind of magical place.Eating at Bert's is like visiting your great-aunt at the home.Sometimes she still has flashes of that old sassy fire, and she was certainly a Texas Tornado in her time.","Austin, TX",193,1110,0,"[375.0, 425.0, 203.0, 67.0, 40.0]",May-11,5213,3832,4033,"['Elite 2021', '’20', '’19', '’18', '’17', '’16', '’15', '’14']"

Sadly, that location burned down in early 2007. I keep forgetting about this particular location, but I, fortunately, just happened to be in the neighborhood, spotted it, and decided I needed to visit even though I had reservations at Austin Land & Cattle Company in 90 minutes.Walking into the place, I was immediately struck by the familiar smell of wood and brisket. This is quite different from those burnt sugar odors emanating from mass chain restaurants that smell like they only serve the infamous McRib.While others opt for the typical BBQ fare, at Bert's, I've always ordered the Frito Pie, and I will always continue to order the Frito Pie. Once you've lived outside of Texas, you will realize how rare a treat it is to experience something so amazing and unique. Even in Dallas, I have yet to find this delectable dish.Yesterday was no different...getting it to-go, I drove back to my parents' house in a huge hurry, unwrapped it like a Christmas present, and proceeded to devour it with some white bread, noting the nuances between the sweetness and smokiness of the meat and the crunchiness and saltiness of the Fritos with the bread and beans helping to bridge the gap.Needless it say, is it the best BBQ I've ever had? Probably not. But, to me, it reminds me of happy times when all I had to worry about was homework the occasional test, and dodging curfew.

Kid's sliders with loaded fries 2. Bacon cheeseburger with loaded fries 3. 11oz Sirloin with rice and loaded baked potato 4.

No ribs is not OK! I get this combo FOR their ribs and save some/all of the sirloin for tomorrow's steak and eggs breakfast. Definite reasons to go back (15-20 min drive 1-way), but yeah, grumpy about it.Cue Cameron, manager: Spoke with him about the missing ribs. Cameron was apologetic, desiring to satisfy a customer. He succeeded!So though my husband's and my steaks were switched regarding doneness and though I drove back to get my ribs, CAMERON is why I'm giving 5 stars. A manager can make or break a customer's desire to return. Yes, Cameron provided compensation, but he did so professionally and with genuine concern to not only satisfy us but he related he'll review the issue with his team/staff.

Overall rating: 3.5 stars, so rounded up to 4.  If you want to skip the details, scroll down to ""SUMMARY"" below.We hadn't been in awhile, so we were all delighted the birthday girl chose Texas Roadhouse.Our party of 6 was sat at a table vs a booth, and it was awesome - more room vs being squished in 3-across.Our server Olivia was pleasant as could be and gave great recommendations. The manager stopped by a couple of times to check that we were satisfied. Then there's Leelee: she did not seat us, but since our table bordered the main thoroughfare, she passed by frequently leading guests to their tables. I couldn't help but overhear her again and again informing each group of the specials, always with the same enthusiasm.Our night concluded with the birthday girl -however reluctantly- getting on the saddle! Family photo-op! Olivia was so kind to observe her wishes: saddle yes, the rest of the hoopla no.Our fare (with individual star ratings):-Hot & delicious rolls with their signature yummy butter. We got 2 baskets for the 4 of us who arrived first. Person arriving next got 1 roll. And unfortunately, the last person to arrive only got a 1/2 of a cold roll that was left. Olivia was very busy and was hard to find/catch. We didn't mind too much because it's so easy to eat too many rolls.  Rolls & butter always get 5 stars! 3 stars tonight because 2 in our party didn't get hot ones, as many as they would've liked, and there was no offer for more.- 2 Peach Fuzz's (Fuzzes? lol) - Meh. Tasted like peach juice. Alcohol in there? Scant. 1 star.- 2 Cape Cods - a little better? 2 stars.- 2 Black Russians - um, consult the manual: Kahlua & vodka (& nothing else). But, it's not uncommon that many places put seltzer in it (but that's not correct!). 3.5 stars.- Lemonade, sweet tea (""perfect"" amount of sweetness=not overly sweet), Dr. Peppers. 5 stars.- Rattlesnake Bites - tasty fried balls of melty cheese and diced jalapenos served with creamy horseradish sauce.  3 out of 5 for ""Would I order them again?""- Filet medallions with loaded steak fries and green beans. Cooked perfectly to order. Loaded fries = REAL shredded cheese (vs the liquidy alternatives) and a decent amount of bacon. 4 stars.- Steakhouse filet salad (my usual). Steak cooked perfectly to order. WAY to much dressing: Olivia asked if I wanted the Italian drizzle on the side. I ok'd it to be added since she said DRIZZLE. Well, my salad got a DELUGE. Darn, I really wanted to enjoy more of it, but couldn't.  2 stars.1 extra star for being cooked to order.- 11oz Sirloin, cooked to order, with rice and loaded fries. 3.5 - 4 stars.- Pulled pork dinner with mushrooms and fries - WOW! A HUGE amount of pork served with 2 slices of buttered & grilled bread. And WOW, the side of mushrooms was delish! 5 stars.- Smokehouse burger with loaded fries, cooked to order, and again YUM to mushrooms. 5 stars.- Kid's mini cheeseburgers with fries - 5 stars (because this kid always loves them, and tonight was no exception).SUMMARY:- GOLD STARS go to the cooks tonight - every burger and steak was cooked perfectly (& each in my family orders differently).- TOP-RATED ENTREES (from our orders): Burgers and pulled pork dinner.- TOP-RATED SIDES (from our orders): Mushrooms, loaded fries, green beans- RECOMMEND the table if you're a party of 6.- DISAPPOINTMENTS: Not enough/cold rolls for our late arrivals; no offer for moreCocktails were weakly poured.If you like greens drowning in dressing, order the salad as is. Otherwise, ask for dressing on the side.PLEASANT ENDING: For as many drinks and food ordered for 6 including the upcharges, our bill wasn't too painful ($140).","Bellevue, WA",913,726,1049,"[274.0, 272.0, 99.0, 53.0, 28.0]",Sep-08,3353,877,2089,"['Elite 2021', '’20', '’19', '’18', '’17', '’16', '’15', '’14', '’13']"

Already this is starting of bad and i'm not happy. If you have an online waitlist it should be more accurate than arrive and then still have to wait another 20 min. I do not recommend just showing up and waiting, try to book online if at all possible.  If you have to wait for a table, the waiting area is small and where you check in is small and usually very crowded.After waiting we are notified out table is ready and we are led to our table by a hostess that has with her a warm basket of rolls that we begin to snack on upon being seated. Besides the having to wait hiccup everything else went smooth that's why i still rated them 4 stars. The last few restaurants we have been to the service has been kind of bad like the servers were out of practice or something, but not at Texas Roadhouse their service is on point. We always get great service and the food is always good.  The road kill is my favorite i recommend to get it covered with the onion, mushrooms, jack cheese, and brown gravy.  I wish they had better sides to choose from .  I mean you can't go wrong with a loaded baked potato or steak fries, but i feel their other sides like the corn or mashed potatoes are average at best.","Pflugerville, TX",49,2,13,[],Feb-19,0,0,0,['never']

BBQ - especially BBQ in Central Texas - has been elevated to such great heights that grading BBQ has become unfairly skewed for long time establishments that have been consistently great at being good. Pok e Jo's is one such establishment. For decades now they have been delivering a consistent experience with some of the best sides in the game. The brisket is consistently good, the sausage is pretty great and the chicken is always on point - especially the dark meat. In this new COVID reality, I've made it a point to throw some of my humble business local restaurants whenever I can.  When I get take-out, I try my best to ensure it's from a local joint. With that in mind, I offloaded the stress of Thanksgiving dinner to Poke e Jo's this year. Money well spent. The turkey was great and I don't really care for Turkey. There's a reason I only eat turkey once or twice a year but I will definitely eat Pok e Jo's smoked turkey year round. It is that good. I am also pretty indifferent to stuffing but this stuffing was legitimately good. The gravy was also great. The usually great green bean & potato casseroles were consistent with how great they usually are.All in all - an awesome holiday meal with minimal effort on my part. The prep & clean up easily justify the price and I'm planning on doing this every Thanksgiving from now until I'm under the dirt.If you're looking for foodie-grade, world beating BBQ - this isn't that. We are incredibly lucky to live an great city with the best BBQ in the world and there are places that have that.I gotta say, though: I will forever miss the hamburgers, beef ribs, and black bean pico.If you want really good BBQ with a variety of good sides, options to feed large groups of people, and friendly staff?

And we placed the order online in advance--ordered at 3 to be picked up at 5. When we arrived, I ran in to get it, and it hadn't been made.

Poor guy, I bet he hoped I wouldn't notice. I can understand how it would be easy to forget an order that was placed hours in advanced. Anyway. The funny part was when we got home. The 30+ lbs of food came in a large paper bag and my husband the genius thought it made sense to hold the bag by its two tiny string handles. Naturally, the bottom gave way and our food spilled out all over the driveway.  He started cussing up a storm, cursing Pok-e-Jo's, saying it was all their fault and that he should sue. I tried so hard not to laugh because he was really furious. But I mean, come on, it was totally his fault. So a warning to all: don't do what my husband did! Use common sense!

They're only serving bottles/cans at this point but why have a soda when you can get a bottled Lone Star?I got a 1/2 pound of the moist brisket, which I assumed is what they called fatty brisket and the new potatoes along with the aforementioned beer and some pickles and onions. I was expecting meh barbecue, thinking this place runs more on nostalgia than anything else but I was surprised to find the brisket was indeed moist but not overly greasy and I probably should have double downed on the meat because I found the potatoes to just be ok.

Unlike its parent, it is in an swanky suburban retail park at Belterra Village, with very modern vibe. I think it fitting that you walk past the huge, well-equipped and enclosed pit area when you walk from the parking lot to the entrance. Holy Mary, do they have a lot of huge smokers.We've made several visits here since the opened a very few years ago. We've watched them through the vagaries of opening and getting their act together, and we cut them considerable slack for a while. And they I,proved over time.This visit was for Friday dinner prior to Memorial Day weekend. Expecting it to be slammed because of the hellacious traffic on 290, we were more than pleasantly surprised that the crowd was much less than oppressive. They have plenty of space, and while it lacks the funky soul of the old Styles Switch, it is a pleasant ambiance, spacious, clean, well lit. Hospitality was top notch, and Jackson, our server was very attentive and personable. One star for that.Brisket, to me, is the raison d'etre of a Central Texas BBQ joint. The Switch has learned over time to do it very well. Tender, juicy, and just, well, pretty. That was less satisfactory when they were learning early, but they've learned their lessons. Three stars for that. Sides on the other hand were disappointing. The complimentary hush puppies were fried in old grease, but the butter salvaged them and made for a nice start. The corn casserole tonight was tepid. Ordinarily, it is rich, creamy and savory and, at least, warm. I wish I'd sent it back to be nuked to an acceptable temperature. The cole slaw was 'meh'. The portions are large on the plated meat meals, so that somewhat offsets the deficit. And reasonable pricing saves the sides from being a star-deduction.Access is easy if you're traveling west on 290 to the wine country or wherever, so if you want really good brisket, the Switch is worth the stop.","Dripping Springs, TX",0,28,23,"[11.0, 0.0, 2.0, 3.0, 12.0]",Jan-11,37,7,2,['never']

We had been to the original shop out on North Lamar in the past and found it funky with credible food.The new Belterra Village addition is certainly welcome, and we had high hopes.First, when you walk up from the parking lot, you pass a MASSIVE smoking area with MASSIVE smokers in rows and a tangy wood smell. This is BBQ production done right. Inside, it is clean and modern and efficient. While I prefer the funky, re-purposed ambience of the old Switch, this is just fine on its own.As to the food, they've added  number of Cajun dishes that weren't on the menu at the other place.  Spouse had a kind of Cajun pot pie, which she didn't care for. But the Switch is, at heart, a BBQ joint, so I am not going to let that affect this review. First time, I had the brisket, the de facto measure of BBQ joints. Excellent. Better than my last visit to the Salt Lick.  Right below Franklins and La Barbecue on my scale of Austin briskets. Good smoke ring, slightly crisp rind, tender and moist throughout. Doesn't need sauce (but you should try their mustard sauce - sparingly). Second visit, with our son in from SF. He lived in Austin for several years and the original Switch was one of his favorites. It was the weekend, so we could get the beef short ribs, which we did. STUPID GOOD! Gigantic short  rib big enough for three with leftovers. Amazingly tender, amazing flavor. Retained the smoke tang.  We also had the pork ribs, which stand up well against the competition (but aren't as good as mine when I am  on my game).Sides can be delicious.

I was however excited to hear of the expansion of a sister restaurant near my house that served their signature BBQ plus some Cajun specialties.I ventured early in the afternoon the day after they opened. A hostess type person greeted me and asked where I would like to dine. I chose the bar versus the actual dining area. Not sure how the line option works; as I left the line was quite long though. Togo perhaps?I wished I could have tried some of the Cajun cuisine but the main dishes are only served after 4pm. This doesn't make a primarily lunch guy too happy. What I did order was delicious. The jalapeno cheddar sausage wore a crisp casing and was a bargain at around $3.

I broke this rule for Switch, and I'm a better man for it. Switch is a permutation of Stiles Switch, with roughly 90% of the menu devoted to Texas style BBQ and the remaining 10% comprising cajun or creole influenced dishes. Now if I'm honest, the only reason we ended up here was because Pious was closed for Summer break. They do that? Apparently.The decor is roomy and modern, without being too try-hard. They have electric jellyfish on tap, which is a great start, though I suppose it's become ubiquitous after winning heaps of awards. The only downside of the entire meal was the ""hye"" fashioned. While it looks incredible on paper (garrison brothers bourbon, a mezcal infused cherry, bitters, etc), in practice it was an absolute sugar bomb. We went for brunch, I had the Texas toast sandwhich with damn near everything on it (brisket, bacon, egg, tomato) while the wife had the brisket hash. The common theme? Excellent brisket that absolutely made both dishes. Great crust, a deep smoke ring, incredible flavor. (Side note: why is it so difficult to find truly great brisket in Austin???). Switch made a great call on the Texas toast, going for slightly sweet instead of garlicly, which I thought was a solid play for a brunch item. I have to award a bonus star to any place that calls their family platter ""The Trough."" Sorry, that's a rule. The tab came out to just under $50, though without the hye fashioned, we would've been well under $40, and we both left completely stuffed, which is a real value.","Austin, TX",0,54,0,"[40.0, 5.0, 3.0, 2.0, 4.0]",Feb-08,78,8,15,['never']

My biggest challenge here was not saying anywhere on the menu that the potato salad is made with sour cream. I'm lactose intolerant and that very nearly derailed my entire evening. I even asked about dairy in the smothered cabbage and the server missed that opportunity to point out the dairy in my other side. The brisket was tender and juicy, and the turkey was very moist and tender. The bbq sauce is sweet and spicy with a nice spice blend. The cucumber-tomato salad had a nice vinaigrette marinade too. To be honest, though, the smothered cabbage was a bit sweet for my taste. I would get the salad again but pass on the cabbage dish. My husband had the poboy, remarked on the wonderful blend of flavors and the tender shrimp.

Now the new staff cut the food portions in half, lump food in center of the tortilla. So half of the tortilla is empty that you squeeze the middle lump out. Now you have a small thin breakfast taco.

The holiday food they get from them is awful. I think the catering we have gotten from  there at work is what initially help skew and influence my opinion of them. I'm hesitant to improve my review thinking bout how bad that food is. What I've decided to do is just let that go and review only my experiences at this location. Now that I have lived in Central Texas for a few years I can see Bill Miller for what it is, a great local fast food chain with an awesome home cooked spin. Its not about anything the convenience factor here.So I gave them one star initially and I cant say that most of things I said are completely wrong. The BBQ is the worst you can get probably in the whole town. The thing is the Bill Miller markets itself a BBQ joint in a town that actually has the best BBQ in the world.If I think about Bill Miller in comparison to just about any BBQ in town it falls flat. If ignore their attempts to be a BBQ restaurant and treat them like a cheap fast food restaurant, which I would argue is what they are they shine!The BBQ poor isn't bad at all for the price and will make you much happier than anything you could get McDonald's, Jack in the box or Wendy's. The special that comes with two BBQ sandwiches and a side for 5 bucks is one of the best lunch deals in town. Sure the chipped beef might give you heart burn and  be a bit runny. Its still better than the other options at its price point. I get the chicken fried steak meal occasionally with rings in at just under 8 bucks and I daresay is not only not bad but actually very good. I always seem to have a wait a bit longer for the steak but it still falls into the fast food time frame and I know they don't cook it till I order it. That's right they actually cook me a fresh chicken Fried steak.. A quick trip through a drive through and I get pretty darn good Chicken Fried Steak! I started out writing this review with the intent of upgrading my one star review to a three star. By the end of writing this I decided they deserve 4 stars. I could go on about how good the Tea is, about how the green beans seem to have improved since my last visit and about how the mashed potatoes are chunky but I don't think I need to.

Because they aren't like gross processed McDonalds fries that last forever, Our fries can go soft after sitting under the heating lamp for a while. We don't cook them in bulk because then they'd all be mushy! the wait really isn't all that bad either, it only takes 4 minutes to cook from the time they are put in the fryer.really, fresh food from this place is the best.time to cook fresh food:Fried Chicken: 15-20minsStrips: 8-10 minsFrench Fries: 4-6 minsChicken Fried Steak (always cooked fresh to order) 6-8 MinutesRibs (highly suggested fresh) 8-10 minsFried Chicken Sandwich 5-6 minsBrisket:This is delicious! as long as you aren't the type to be grossed out by a little fat. and really not for the person trying to watch their figure. This one you would probably want to be cut fresh too. The way we serve this is by the #. (a 1/4# one serving) You can ask for a couple of different options:Marbled (moist and tender, more likely to have fat)Lean (less fat but can still be there, also not as greasy)Extra Lean(where they really try and get as much fat off as possible. But the meat can still be tender! don't get this confused with marbled!)No Ends (this cuts off the harder black pieces at the ends of each slice.--- the smokier parts)--lean choices are more likely to be dry..... you can also ask for a combination of lean and marbled- for the lean choices you can also ask for the meat to be sliced thin!)And just as a note as to why fresh food is the best thing to ask for here: It's not because its Bill Miller's, It's because its Bill Miller's in Austin. We don't get nearly as busy here as the stores in San Antonio, so we try to wait to cook our fresh food until peak hours. don't get too frustrated though if you come near closing time and have to wait 15 minutes for a family order of chicken, You're probably the 4th car in a row to order it. people like to do that at night.....THE SERVICE:we are super nice!! :D The manager's are so cool and will gladly sit down with you and have a nice chat! they'll even offer you free dessert if you had to wait too long! The employees themselves can be a bit fussy at times but I think that's just how some of them are. But usually they're only fussy with each other and more than willing to help out a customer in anyway possible to make their meal even more enjoyable. The trick is to smile back. CONCLUSIONOur prices are much cheaper than other BBQ places you will find, especially in Austin, The environment is very casual, but with way better than average customer service of fast food chains. you order and get your food from the front, but we bus your tables-- fusion of fast food and family sit down restaurant. Fresh food is usually the best asking for fries. only takes 5mins.It's not The best restaurant, but It gives a bang for your buck, and you're eyes will definitely be bigger than your stomach here.Personal favorites:-- #1 Poorboy with side order and a drink (Sweet Tea is to Die for!)The Quick Menu:Meats: Brisket, Ham, Turkey, Sausage, Ribs, Chop (a brisket and bbq sauce mix that plays the part of sloppy joe)Sides: Pinto Beans, Green beans, Hash browns, Coleslaw, potato salad, spanish rice, mashed potatoes, french fries.all super delish.","Austin, TX",201,30,11,"[13.0, 11.0, 4.0, 2.0, 0.0]",May-11,9,0,6,['never']

When I received an Uber eats gift card for my birthday, I decided to choose a restaurant to which I had never been and Gyu- Kaku seemed perfect.I ordered a huge amount of food for myself, my husband, and our visiting son. We had chicken karaage, a chicken Karaage bowl, garlic chicken noodles, two types of wings, the Gyu-Kaku salad, and some dumplings, as well as a bowl of Ramen (which I could not eat at the time and save for a lunch later that week).The food was delivered in a timely fashion and was absolutely wonderful. Each person got a little bit of everything except Ramen. My son especially loved the wings and we almost had a fist fight over who got the last ones :-). The chicken karaage was also wonderful - finding this dish can be difficult and I was surprised at how good it was. Oddly enough, the salad was one of my favorite things because the ginger soy dressing was perfect! The potstickers/dumplings were very good too, but everything was excellent so it is easy to forget which thing was my favorite. I saved the Ramen for another day because we had too much food, and it was incredibly good a couple of days later. Since December, I have ordered twice more from this restaurant, and both times it has been so good that I wanted to order again almost immediately.

Salads, noodles, etc were quickly rolled out - except none of us had plates. We flagged down a different server, who then played telephone to our server, who finally brought plates and chopsticks to us. 3 of us had napkins. The other made do as we were pretty hungry. Our waiter then told us a volcano tuna was coming, and that he would be right back. Almost thirty minutes later, he came back with 4 plates of meat. We never got the volcano tuna.After a quick explanation on cook times, our waiter zoomed off. We flagged another waiter, who then played telephone with our waiter, who then took our bar order for the second round of drinks. The beer is bountiful. About an hour later, our waiter came back with the second half of dinner - the remaining 4 meat dishes. He then zoomed off and we noticed the larger table behind us, despite having been seated at the same time as us, had already started eating their s'mores dessert. Another hour later, after our dinner is long complete, our waiter comes back with the promise of s'mores. I guess the s'mores are pre-skewered, since he came back with marshmallows pretty quickly. We order a final round of drinks with him, as well as asking for a few glasses water. This time, the beers never come and the waters also never come. My friend gets a graham cracker caught in her throat and crunches ice to help. Our waiter is gone.We then ask for the check. We sit at the table, waiting over 30 minutes for someone to cash us out. We ask the bar if they can close us out, but they don't have a POS system. So we continue to wait... and wait... and wait. Finally, a different waiter notices us and brings the electronic machine to close our table out. An end. The food is not bad.

I prefer it over Korean. Overall, the quality of meat is much better; cuts are smaller where it takes seconds to cook. It's not marinated with a thick sauce. With that, there's a series of cuts that have less marinade to let you taste the meat quality. Most are medium to high marbling of meat. Another section, Umakara, is where the meat is sitting in a savory, ""Uma (umami)"" and slightly spicy ""Karai"".

Had previously gone to the Houston location which was great. They specialize in Yakiniku, which is a 'cook it yourself' concept very similar to Korean BBQ. The location just opened recently so there were some hiccups as they get a hang of service. Went with a group of 3 and we reserved ahead of time in compliance of COVID precautions in place. They did a good job there- spaced out seating, hand sanitizer stations and temp checks. Waiters wore gloves and masks. The menu has a few ways of ordering- combo meals preset for 2-4 people or a la carte with a ton of options. We ended up getting a combo meal for 2 with a few extra bowls of rice and we left incredibly full. This includes salad, miso soup, beef sushi (cooked) and a bunch of cuts of meat for grilling. Their cocktails are amazing btw, so good i'd classify them as dangerous. We got the mango and lychee ones and got absolutely hammered on them. Super tasty and summery. Now while the servers were great- we had some issues /hiccups. Mainly after appetizers they were very slow to bring out meat- the main course. It was long enough that they apologized. Shortly after we were told one of our meat options was 'out'...the filet, which was one of the cuts we were looking forward to. The server made the mistake of stating that some chuck they bought out was an 'upgraded cut' to make up for it which if you know meat, that's a strange claim. Chuck is a cheaper cut. Was willing to overlook that as the servers seemed new and were probably training. We grilled all the cuts and they were great, next time we'll probably just order a la carte to have better control of what we get. They have a ton of options and variety so its a place worth revisiting. The garlic rice was fantastic as an add on. Overall was a fun experience despite the hiccups. Location is nice, food is good and be sure to get the s'mores. Look forward to visiting again once they fully get into the swing of things.","Austin, TX",59,132,141,"[58.0, 44.0, 16.0, 9.0, 5.0]",Apr-10,307,72,138,"['Elite 2021', '’20', '’10']"

Then a second hostess greeted us and asked about our reservation and then took our temp a second time. She asked us to wait an additional 10 minutes and then took us to a dirty table and then had us follow her around cluelessly until she realized there were no clean tables available. Took us back to the host stand to wait. Plus no one acknowledged the fact that our reservation was for a special occasion. Then she takes us to a large table where we watched every other table be greeted and served while we waited to be approach for our drinks. After waiting for the waiter I approached the host stand again and the second hostess apologized and she took our drink orders (we never got the drinks). Our waiter eventually showed up and apologized for the the inconvenience and took our orders. He was actually pretty nice and made the experience bearable.

It's similar to a KBBQ style, in which you cook your own meats on a grill at your table, so expect the meats/veggies to come to you raw. You can do an a la carte or a prefixed menu. We chose to do a la carte.Food/drink: Pork gyoza were delish! Full of flavor and nice and crispy. The meat (ordered the prime Kobe short rib, Harami skirt steak, UMAKARA ribeye, pork belly, and spicy pork) was delicious, tender and well seasoned. The veggies (we ordered the assortment) were fine, just a basic assortment of baby tomatoes, zucchini slices, mushrooms, and shishto peppers, no seasoning. The drinks were very good (ordered the lychee mojito and geisha), strong but delicious at the same time. Service: Abiding to COVID procedures, the staff were all masked and wore gloves when we were welcomed. They took our temperature and set us at a table that was well distanced from other parties. They were friendly and attentive, offering cooking times for meats and keeping an eye out for if the grill flames got high. Cons: The portions were small for the price. I feel like I could have gone to a classic KBBQ for the same price and left with a fuller tummy. Also, aside from the Japanese greeting/goodbye, I couldn't tell what made this a ""Japanese"" BBQ, as opposed to a ""Korean"" BBQ. They had similar cuts of meat, and Korean dishes like bibimbap, kimchi, and chigae.

The salsa was just sad, anything taken at random off a grocery shelf would be better. The fried green tomatoes were cut way too thick, had a heavy, thick, cloddish breading and was served with a really blah ranch dressing.  The potato skins were mediocre, absolutely nothing to make them stand out. The chicken wings with the spicy sauce were far over-cooked and the sauce tasted strange and was really incredibly hot...and I love hot food. On the positive side, the smoked turkey is darn good as is most of the BBQ items. The fries are really good as well. The grounds are a real draw, with a huge tree-covered outdoor play area with super kids' play-scapes. This they really aced.

It's inconsistent... sometimes a whisper, and on Kid's nights  and Sunday brunch, it can be an assault. Bummer. They could treat the neighbors better by putting up a simple wall behind the stage. Mostly, the music is a cut above what most outdoor venues offer in this area.( I'm a guy who does guitar work for folks like Eric Johnson/David Grissom/ Redd Volkaert /etc) ..KInd of a ""critic"". Service: VERY friendly and courteous.Wait: It's often15 minutes in line and 15 minutes to get your order. That's too long.If I call in an order, they tell me it'll be ready in 5 minutes ... BUT; when I get there to pick up my order, I sometimes STILL have to wait 15 minutes in line to pick up my order. That wastes my time.They NEED a way to do pick-up orders MUCH more efficiently.Bar: Good selection, fast service, and makes the (often) long-ish wait for your food ( if you're not picking up) more palatable. Friendly staff at the bar. Food:  Love the sandwiches of all kinds. To- go sandwiches are great too.  Fajita nachos are great. (!!) ( I suggest you don't get them to go though ... they come in a ""kit"" where you have to put them together yourself ... NOT as good as what they serve in-house, at the table, in my opinion and that of my friends) Ribs: Tried them 3X to try to be be fair. Pretty bad.If you want to get good ribs; go to Black's , or take a trip to Lockhart, or go to a little roadside shack called ""Benny's""... east of the flyover on 71 ( Cedar creek) or go to Kerlin's on east 12th. I'd say :""Franklin's"" ....... but I don't need to deal with the wait. There's always Rudy's ion 360, and Ruby's, on Guadalupe.... Or Salt Lick ( good meat ... hate their sides) . Point is; There are better ribs out there. The deal with the ribs @ Stubb's is that they have a LOAD of black pepper and other spices which over-ride and obscure the flavor of the meat. Those ribs appeal to the crowd who think; ""It MUST be good.... see how hot and peppery it tastes"" I'm sorry, but when you've had good ribs, you know what  good ribs are. Access;Good.  BUT; If you have kids, park close to Stubb's. Why? The speed limit is 45 mph on Circle drive, and crossing Circle to get to Stubb's is NOT safe.There have been several near-miss instances where an excited child darted out from between parked cars to cross Circle drive to get to Stubb's. Even IF the speed limit was 30 mph, it'd still be dangerous. Watch your kids (!) crossing that road.Ambience:The ONLY thing about the place that is self-defeating is the volume of the music. I've seen parents SCREAMING at their kids, ( on Kid's night) trying to be heard over the volume of the music, and the kids not being able to hear parents. Frustrating for both. HOWEVER; this is not consistent: ... Sometimes, the music level is just fine, and parents and kids alike can communicate, relax, and have fun.  Other than that, the ambience is Wonderful.  play-scapes, etc.  .... GREAT place for kids and parents to go have fun.Price/ reward.  Overall; if you consider travel times, parking hassles at inner -city places, etc.... this is a very good neighborhood place to go ""kick back""... just needs a few refinements to be top notch.","Austin, TX",0,42,0,"[33.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 5.0]",Sep-10,57,7,10,['never']

I went to a local brewery and they offered food through Wunder Pig Barbecue food truck. Boy, was I disappointed.The menu isn't extensive. They offer Meats, Sides, Classic Sandwiches, and drinks. I wanted brisket but surprise surprise...no brisket. So I ordered a pulled pork sandwich. Twelve minutes later I received a Styrofoam box with my sandwich, a side of mustard, barbecue sauce, creamed jalapeno spinach, and jalapenos.The pulled pork was just ""ok"". There really wasn't any flavor to the meat but it was moist which was on a grocery store bought bun. Hmmmm. The bun wasn't prepared at all. It wasn't warm, or toasted, or with any spread at all. The jalapenos that I ordered, were about a tablespoon of jalapenos from the pickled jalapeno jar that I saw on a counter inside the truck. They weren't prepared at all either. Just a scoop of jalapenos. The creamed jalapeno spinach was a half a cup of cream cheese and spinach. It was just ""ok"" to. The thing is that the side said it was to have jalapenos in it. I didn't see or taste any jalapeno in any of it.What a waste of a meal. I could have had better. Don't stop here if you have an option. Or better yet, have a drink at the brewery and then Uber somewhere else, anywhere else. I give them 2 stars because it wasn't gross and scary, but less than ""OK"". I hope they don't think they are going to do any ""breaking in"" into the Austin BBQ scene. Based on this performance I think they have a long road ahead of them.","Honolulu, HI",279,2,1,[],Nov-15,1,1,1,['never']

Some pretty harsh stuff for sure. Nonetheless, I was happy to hear you could get out of your office job to come into the brewery. Must be brutal on the bones to sit at a desk all day.  And since you took the time to break down your out of town experience on us and the brewery and went even as far as saying we shouldn't think of ""breaking in"" to the Austin scene, I felt in only appropriate for the sake of my hard working team to respond on this one. I think it's only fair to let you know we've actually been open for almost 6 years now - in Austin.  We're adding two more trucks to the fleet currently and have built a pretty strong following with repeat customers at the brewery. And yes we've had write-ups in case you're wondering. In either case, I wanted to clarify a few things.  To start, I wanted to let you in on a little secret (shhhhh) Ready...Okay hear it is...not sure how they do things in Houston, but running out of brisket is actually a REAL THING if it's a popular item on the menu.  (crazy I know, right?!) Also, we are a traditional/classic style barbecue spot.  We don't use fancy style buns because, well... this is barbecue? And even though we pride ourselves on meats primarily, the buns we do use are Martin's Dutch Potato rolls - which in case you didn't know are what a good amount of the bbq spots in the ""Austin BBQ scene"" actually use  (i.e. Valentina's, La Barbecue, Franklin, etc).  I know this because we have the same sales rep that delivers to us. Since it sounds like you have an extensive background in the BBQ field (apparently), you'd probably also know that traditional old time BBQ spots sometimes only serve barbecue up on plain white bread for the sandwich since the focus is on the meat and quite frankly, some people prefer it that way. And that's fair if you felt the pork was little lacking in flavor. We'll take note of that and appreciate the feedback no less. We do offer a more extensive menu on the weekend since that is when the brewery has the most traffic with a variety of specials.  Moreover, regarding the packaging - as you can see from all of our Yelp photos we use kraft boats served on a tray board in traditional fashion, but we gave you to-go styrofoam box because it was actually raining (ridiculous I know, who would do that? Ughh). Unless I'm guessing you would've preferred your food extra moist, possibly?  Yes our jalapenos are jarred which is pretty common for barbecue, we do make homemade smoked-garlic pickles and do pickled onions if that's frilly enough for ya. As far as the jalapeno creamed spinach that you said had no jalapenos in it, not sure if you realize this, but we finely chop it and cook it on the smoker with the cream cheese, special seasonings and spinach. Spinach color you ask? Yup you guessed it - GREEN just like jalapenos.  (poof -total mind blower) I always find it interesting when someone who isn't a part of the industry somehow considers themselves a self-proclaimed food critic ""picky foodie/home chef"" (that's cute). Almost as if one day it's like. ""Hey I woke up today, watched enough food network and presto! I officially certified myself in all things cuisine!""  Lastly, the next time you want to share someone's food and want to do it some justice, please take a photo that doesn't look like you're in a desolate cave.  And not trying to tell you how to be a photographer or anything, cause I'm sure you got a ""picky-photo guy"" certification badge lying around somewhere I'll bet.

I really pride myself on being one of those people that stans slept on joints. Wunder Pig is definitely a sleeper in the Austin BBQ scene and that's a shame. If I go to Austin during the week, I usually look at their calendar to see if I can catch them on a lunch rush. Imagine my surprise (and delight) when I went to Oskar Blues this weekend and the glorious smell of smoke hit my nose while driving up and there was WP in all it's glory. The line they had was intimidating, but when they're hand slicing meats and have three dudes in that tiny trailer, you have to give them props (and patience!). Word on the street is they are Oskar Blues permanent food truck, win-win!The sandwiches are the stars here, for the amount of meat and food you get, it's a steal and a half. I am never left wanting more. My all-time favorite is the Pig Vicious (pulled pork and sausage? yes please!). The Wunder Wich is their brisket based one. Although, they had specialty sandwiches this weekend that were bad ass, my best friend got the brisket frito pie and I had the chicken with green chile mac and cheese. Both were excellent and I hope they guest star again soon. Their sauces compliment their sandwiches perfectly, their mustard sauce is to die for and now they're apparently making it with a stout from Oskar Blues, super cool.Alright, I know why you're still reading. But what about the BRISKET! Listen, I never fault any BBQ day for having an ""off"" day, which is why I only review BBQ joints after I've been enough times to really get a feel for the pitmaster's skills. The bark on the brisket from Wunder Pig is probably one of my all time favorites, it's delicious and flavorful, you know the pitmaster knows his smoker and how to get the best flavor from it. You know, I never used to be a huge pulled pork fan, but I'll be damned if Wunder Pig didn't make me a believer. It's a little sweet and plays so well with the sides.I know everyone says BBQ isn't about the sides, it should be about the meat. But would you go to a burger joint and be okay with subpar fries? Nah, probably not. This is where Wunder Pig smashes it out of the park completely. Their potato salad has a certain je ne sais quoi (Jenna said what?!) that I can't put my finger on, but it's damn delicious. The jalapeno creamed spinach has the right amount of kick and flavor to be different and make everyone's least favorite vegetable, sexy. The main meat man and owner, Mems is really gracious and very approachable. I've seen him walking around and talking to customers to make sure they're happy, which is a big plus in my book. tl;dr: sleeper BBQ trailer specializing in ridiculously unique, delicious, and filling sandwiches, stellar sides, and sauces. Come hungry and with patience, it'll be worth it in the end. *heavy breathing* Meat sweats for days!","San Antonio, TX",141,44,41,"[24.0, 2.0, 5.0, 5.0, 8.0]",Jun-17,44,6,10,['never']

The bad parts are the food! I ordered the 1 meat plate with natural brisket, macaroni & cheese, and coleslaw ($11.79) and I kid you not that nothing on my plate was warm. You'd think at a minimum that the brisket would be warm but the entire tray of food was cold like it had been sitting out for a few hours. The brisket was very dry for it being a fatty slice (you have the option of choosing the cut e.g., fatty or lean) and the coleslaw was just okay. The rising star was the mac & cheese that was quite cheesy, but because it was cold... you feel me lol. The rest of the table got the chopped natural brisket sandwich and two other 1 meat plates. Two of four meals were served completely cold (old?). They were also out of the potato salad and brisket beans. Honestly the only reason we came was for the $2.00 draft beers, so I'm happy about that, but I wouldn't give the food a second thought. The convenience of having a restaurant inside of my favorite HEB is nice but for the quality of food, I think it's overpriced.

Since I live less than a mile from this joint and they have a drive-thru, I thought I'd give 'er a go. For a holiday, I wasn't sure what to expect as far as a line. I arrived at 11:40 AM and from the time I got there, to the time I drove off, it took 19 minutes total. Not terrible, especially for all you Whataburger freaks who wait an hour for a burger, but I digress.I opted for the moist brisket, and a side of macaroni, cole slaw, and creamed corn. The bark on the brisket was a little tough. The flavor was good, but not the best I've ever had. The macaroni was good. The cole slaw was a little bland, but I love how thinly it's shredded. The creamed corn was very smoky/black peppery. I wasn't offered or given any bread, pickles or onions. I was given a choice of BBQ sauce: sweet, spicy or tangy. I got tangy and it was not good lol. But, good meat shouldn't need sauce in my humblest of opinions. Whether or not you'll like this place probably depends on where you usually go. If Bill Miller is your goto, this is probably a step up. If you usually endure a muggy August day in line at a smoky trailer for an hour for the perfect piece of meat, this will probably leave you missing your regular spot.

Eric always serves quality food, but honestly the burger surprised me. Damn it was delicious! The bun was not soggy, and the meat was cooked perfectly....and the fries...oh damn the fries!

There's a reason why BBQ shouldn't be made quickly; and this place is the prime example. Corn on the cob- Extremely soggy and under seasoned. It's as if they boiled the corn and left it in the water for hours until someone ordered it. There was not even any salt added to the water. Green beans- Extremely bland. No seasoning added to this either. Certainly canned beans (which I usually don't mind...Hell, I'll eat them straight out of the can for lunch sometimes) but it tasted as if they left them soaking in salt-less water just like the corn. Baked potato- Not terrible. Good amount of flavor, not too mushy. However, seems a handful of shredded cheese was tossed on top of it while it was cold not allowing any cheese to melt making a very weird texture. Frito pie- Some of us liked the chili for the brisket, others not so much due to the burnt top. The Fritos were completely soggy as if it was prepared hours in advance. I mean, how hard is it to put Fritos in a container and put some chili on top of them when ordered? 1/2 chicken- Decent. Pretty moist and a decent amount of seasoning and the BBQ sauce that comes with it is pretty good. A little on the pepper/spicy side... it went well with the chicken. Sausage- Enjoyable for a quick BBQ joint. Not too spicy and moist. Brisket- Pretty mild on the seasoning side could use a little more. Cooked well, decently moist. Creamed corn- Fantastic. Perfect. Exactly what you want cream corn to be.Fried Okra- Nothing special. Seems as if it just came off the Sysco truck.. Texture was what it was supposed to be but we wouldn't go back for it.

I think it would surprise no one that my apartment locating office is literally right next door, and yet I'd never bothered to stop in until now. Mostly because my barbecue loyalties lie elsewhere, but a brisket sandwich was a craving I just couldn't deny. It's a small space, but very hill country ""Texas"" in its feel, especially for being located in an unremarkable strip center. The bottles of sauce arranged by the counter disoriented me for a moment, as it reminded me a lot of Rudy's. I had to remember it was Smokey Mo's.I ordered a combo plate for $7.95, which includes your choice of two meats and two sides. I chose brisket and turkey, along with potato salad and fried okra. With a large iced tea, lunch came to around $10. There were two employees, one friendly and the other one a little more abrupt. I'm being polite when I say ""'abrupt"", as when I received my plate, there was no okra. With no explanation, I inquired as to its whereabouts and he sort of snapped: ""It's cooking."" Like I'm automatically supposed to know that. Like I said: abrupt.I also had to ask for bread to make my sandwich; they had told me earlier it was included, but they made me ask them again, and it was sort of thrust at me. Well, OK then... The brisket was lean, and was above average tender. As I munched on the sandwich, I saw a sign that instructed customers to specify whether they wanted moist or lean brisket. I had just said ""brisket"", but no one followed up with ""moist or lean?"" So, I'm assuming I got lean because it was...well, lean. The turkey was nice as well, and I would have liked to make a sandwich out of it, but the guys working there looked like they were eating lunch and I didn't want to bother them for another two slices of bread. The okra was OK (at least it was fresh and hot), but my favorite was hands down the cool, creamy mustard potato salad. I should have had a double serving of that.I noticed a fridge full of pudding and cake desserts, but skipped it for now. Hey--for what it is, it's not bad. It's affordable, accessible barbecue right in my part of town (and next to my office). Even today I have to admit I'm still a little put off by that one guy, though. Maybe he was hungry, because as I left he was chowing down on what looked like a salad topped with brisket.

Second, it was right down the street in the old Hai Kai location on Spicewood Springs.The reviews were good, so I pulled the proverbial trigger. Can I just say that we were utterly charmed? The redo of the place was just right. Dare I say high end-ish casual? Yes. I dare! Lol! The music was perfect. The menu was gorgeously simple and authentically Korean. The beer list was solid. The wine list was impressive! Trapiche? Yes, please! I was pretty sure, right away, that this was going to be a heavy rotation repeat, and it made my heart smile! Team: Local Restaurants Making It Right Now! I wave the flag! The husband ordered his usual Korean fave, Dolsot Beef Bimbimbap, and I, still thinking Hot Pot/Pho/Ramen, went with the Seoul Bulgogi, since its description was thinly sliced marinated beef in special broth. Chris's bimbimbap was as good as his OG bimbimbap at Fort Hood! He had doubts about my choice of restaurant, at first, with his heart being set on hot pot and all, but, after trying it, he started pointing out other things on the menu that he planned to try next time, so he was obv sold! The little side plates of deliciousness were absolutely gorg! And my Seoul Bulgogi, y'all? Holy snaps! Truly good! The broth is sublime! If your belly needs a warm cuddle on a cold night, THIS is the place, and THIS is the dish!

I'm half Korean and originally from NYC, so have been privileged with the quality and authenticity of the Korean food that was available to me from early on. It's also made me a huge snob when it comes to critiquing Korean eateries. I've spent years in Austin looking for a spot that captures the flavors and presentation of the true, old-school Korean food that I grew up loving. But for the most part, every place I've tried has come up a little short. Until this place. Some places overextend themselves by offering too many options, none of which truly shine. Some places go for fusion (looking at you, Chilantro) and don't taste like the real thing at all. Some places try to repackage traditional Korean fare into sleek new concept restaurants, but lose that down-home quality in the process. But not Jan Chi. The menu is short and sweet. All the classic dishes are there. You'll find doenjang-jjigae, kimchi jjigae, bulgogi, and bibimbap. I ordered the kimchi jeon (a big Korean pancake with kimchi cooked in), and it was delicious. Unlike any kimchi jeon I've had before. The flavor is smooth, not too spicy, just the right amount of kick from the kimchi. Plus it doesn't fall apart when you cut into it. I ordered dolsot bibimbap as my main dish. This is bibimbap served in a steaming stone pot (the Korean equivalent of a sizzling fajita coming to your table), and it's a classic. This one did not disappoint. It came out sizzling hot so that the rice on the bottom keeps cooking, which leaves this delicious caramelized rice when you reach the end of the meal. All the ingredients were pristine and tasty, including the meat and the egg served sunny-side up. And the gochujang (chili paste), instead of coming in the usual plastic bottle, was provided in a little serving dish that proved just the right portion. A+ for presentation. It was the best bibimbap I've had in Austin. My mom's order of bulgogi looked great and earned her approval. All in all I was in heaven throughout this meal. The only drawbacks I can see are minor IMO. I didn't see an option to grill meat at the table, which I don't care for but a lot of people like. Maybe they had some grill tables I didn't see. Their banchan (small dish) options are limited, though they opened recently and explained that they're still experimenting with banchan options. But my oh my, I hope you all discover how great this place is so that it stays open for years to come. The location is a little off the beaten path, but the space is so chill. The service is above and beyond. They even made a banchan dish on request by my mom. Shout out to Samuel, who was one of the nicest and most helpful wait staff I've experienced recently. Shout out to the chef. Y'all made us feel welcome and important without trying too hard.

It's kind of funny that the main street sign for the restaurant actually advertises that the place has breakfast tacos, not barbecue. The building itself looks pretty old to say the least. Anyways, the place was completely packed during our first visit at around noon. You can tell right away it's a restaurant that gets all of its business from regulars and word of mouth. Memorabilia from local high schools and community groups line the walls, and the interior is just as rustic as the outside. The menu is short and simple, and all of the plates average about $10-$11. I've tried the brisket and sausage plates so far, which come with the choice of coleslaw or potato salad, the choice of green beans, corn, or beans as your second side, and the usual free pairings like white bread, pickles, etc. If there's a line, it should go by pretty quickly. If you've ever been to Rudy's or a similar establishment, you'll know what to expect.Austin has more than enough barbecue joints, many of which are excellent. I would say the brisket and sausage are both just pretty good; that's probably the only compliment I can give the meats here. However, Vic's has a few other things going for it: the history and sense of community you'll immediately notice, an extremely friendly team, and probably the fastest barbecue experience you'll have around here.

All I ate was the corn and grilled Kim chi that was on the taco because I came hungry expecting to eat something amazingThe fries were cooked perfectly but the topping was alright. It had rib eye on top of it so I didn't enjoy it.The rice bowl mediocre. When I think Korean food, I think of rice in a super hot bowl and the rice here was cold rice so the experience was too relatable to a chipotle bowl but cost more.The wings was the better part of the meal. You can find better Korean fried chicken else where but of all that we ordered, this is at least edible.Gave it a two star because it was wasn't a horrible experience, just not a place I would go back to but at least I can say I experience it.","Fort Worth, TX",246,85,82,"[54.0, 13.0, 10.0, 8.0, 0.0]",Jun-13,101,29,67,"['Elite 2021', '’20', '’19']"

Therefore, even though my food was good, I didn't go back.Almost 17 months later I tried again, and boy, am I glad I did!!! When I finally came back in, there was no line. I asked loads of questions and the staff was helpful and friendly. I built a delicious, nutritious, and filling meal with a special blend of flavors unlike anything else. The best part is that my meal was less than $5!My current favorite is a bowl with half rice, half salad, the Korean beef, grilled kimchi, all the veggies, and a fried egg on top. I cap it with the carrot ginger sauce that I could straight drink. That stuff is finger licking good.

Not sure what changed, but in the last 2-3 years the consistency has declined greatly. Haven't had a 5/5 meal here in a while unfortunately. My go to has always been a ribeye burrito and queso, and while the quesos pretty much the same it seems like I regularly am noticing a poor showing/serving from one or more of the ingredients inside my burrito. The weak ingredients that prompted this review were the tough/chewy rice and sparse beef. The rice didn't taste good and the toughness made the burrito a chewing match. Felt the beef was way lacking quantity wise, I've had this so many times I had certain expectations but I'll freely admit that complaint is more subjective and less of an issue than the rice. My thinking is that I just got a batch that had been sitting a while, but I ordered at 8:30PM rather than right before close.

Last bowl had soy glazed chicken, white rice, lettuce and beans. I had to be the only person that got their #1 seller Chi'Lantro loaded Kimchee fries with soy glazed chicken and all the toppings! (Kimchee, onion, cilantro, sriracha, cheese and more) not gonna lie- my fries were preeeeetty spicy!Everything was good. Including their fountain drinks. My favorite has to be the cream soda! My husband tried their hibiscus drink as well as their pineapple soda. They were all pretty good. Downfall of our experience was that my Father in law chose beef as his protein, and he said it was super oily and waaay too overcooked. Tasted like it's been sitting around. The meat was extremely crumbly. We felt bad so we gave him some of our soy glazed chicken. The chicken was really good! Super flavorful and juicy. Not dry at all.

We would come once a week, sometimes more often pre-COVID and even when they reopened after because they had a good variety on the menu, good service, and a decent selection of beer.But the last three times we have been there we've been really disappointed, including tonight. It's a management issue.1. They don't staff properly anymore. Most nights there is only one person working the floor. I suspect there also is short staffing in the kitchen too because we hear them cursing a lot. This makes for incredibly slow service. Tonight we sat for more than 10 minutes and decided to leave when a big party came in at that point. The cook was outside walking around. Not good.2. Because they are short staffed, the staff who is there is under a lot of pressure. They get frustrated (and they should, their management is putting them in a terrible position). They also make more mistakes because they are so in the weeds, and when you try to get something fixed, it takes a long time. As in, everyone else is done with their food and you just got yours.3. They seem to be trying to cut costs more by reducing menu items. Particularly their beer selection. It used to be great. Now they don't even have staples like Mich Ultra.

Have called in orders of dozens of wings on Sundays for games always requesting they not be dropped in the fryer, knowing and having to acknowledge that they still need to be cooked further - which I as well as those I'd sent your way would do either in the oven or on the grill to finish them off. Sadly when coming in this evening on short notice after a busy SXSW week I was not only told what I'd been doing for years was not possible; your 'kitchen manager' proceeded to demean me at the bar instructing me that what I was requesting was never an option and that I was lying. After a back and forth with him I had to have the server readjust the tab as I did not, and never want, wings dropped in the fryer - making certain to not hold that against her of course and tipped her generously. Regardless this 'kitchen manager's attitude, also acknowledged by the server; her stating that ""he's always shitty...,"" is unacceptable and out right horrible.I don't know if this guy who claims to be an employee of ""25 years"" is your best source of weed but the fact remains him and his attitude is not good for business moving forward.Being an on and off frequenter of your establishment for nearly thirty years, and more recently this south location for the past five + years since relocating down this way, the server didn't hesitate to give me his name when I asked - I'll not post it here as that seems wrong however I'lll address it with him personally - though I doubt he's man enough to own up to his short comings let alone apologize.His sanctimonious attitude alone is enough for me to never recommend your establishment moving forward.

I'm so excited that now there is a brick and mortar restaurant to experience this every day. The back yard is gigantic and will be great once the summer heat dies down. They have lawn games and lots of chairs and tables to relax and enjoy a nice night out. The inside is a lot smaller but we live in Texas after all so the outdoors is where it's at. I do agree with other reviews that they probably should get rid of the piano and oversized tables and chairs to fit more moderate seating. To place your order, you go inside and head straight to the bar where one of the bartenders will take your food order and drink order if you're feeling up to one of their unique cocktails. The food menu is limited but what they make is done well. My favorites are the mac n' cheese, green beans and the chopped beef - with the light bbq sauce.

So I put some of his pork on it too.  Definitely enough to split unless you're a mountain man. Sad to leave half of the pile behind but they just aren't good warmed over. They had a good amount of nacho cheese on them too. Not like some places that are stingy with the cheese. My nephew had the moist brisket and really liked it with the pineapple coleslaw. Which I tried too and it was really good!  We tried the potato salad and it was just ok. Next time I'll try the jalapeño Mac and cheese.  Neat little place. It was a little warm so we ate inside, but they have a really nice outside bier garden.","Georgetown, TX",517,580,866,"[364.0, 165.0, 32.0, 14.0, 5.0]",Apr-14,2406,790,2107,"['Elite 2021', '’20', '’19', '’18', '’17', '’16', '’15', '’14']"

Some things could be better. I was told the bacon wasn't ready when I ordered a grilled cheese with bacon and it was close to noon..so I just got it without bacon..kinda strange to tell your customer bacon isn't ready so basically don't get it and it was already close to 12 pm. grilled cheese was good though. Chopped brisket sandwich was also good, not super greasy like someone had reviewed before. Some of the drink prices are a lil steep..$8.75 bloody marys during brunch time on Sat seems way too high..i know on Sundays they are only $4, so 8.75 seems too high. $1 or 1.50 pulled pork tacos on Tuesdays are tasty and a great price, but I wouldn't pay the regular price for what I believe is only 1 taco any other time because I don't think they are big enough to charge 3.50 each. The pork sliders we have tried and I feel they kinda skimp on the meat so we stopped ordering those. We felt when we got the BBQ plate that it really wasn't enough food for the price. I think they should have burgers all the time instead of only during certain hours/days.  $1 frito pies on Monday is cool, just know that its served in the bag, so don't except something super big or anything, esp when its regular priced. bartenders have always been pretty friendly overall and the outside seating area is pretty cool especially on a nice day.

It was kind of a big order for 2 people. A 2 meat plate (sausage and ribs) coleslaw, beer battered fries and green beans as the sides. Also, a bacon cheeseburger, stuffed jalapeños and a slice of pudding cake. They said it would take 45 minutes to an hour. But it had to be around 30 minutes. The delivery guy said they weren't busy so they got the food out quickly. But when we opened the container we kinda figured out why the food arrived so fast. The food wasn't particularly warm and considering I don't even live 15 minutes away we thought it was weird the food was that cold. The sausage was cut into large chunks and the ends were crusted over indicating it had may have been sitting exposed to the air a bit. The sides were decent. Green beans had pieces of bacon so that's always a plus. The best thing were the ribs. They were tender and smokey. No sauce needed which was good because the barbeque sauce provided was too tomato-y for our taste. The burger wasn't bad. The top bum looked a bit crusty. Not in the 'oh they toasted this perfectly!' kinda way but the 'dude you didn't close the bread bag last night' kinda way. The lettuce, tomato and pickles were sparse and a little limp. But, I guess their logic is you ordered a burger. If you were that worried get a salad. We just bulked it up with condiments and veggies from the kitchen so no biggie.  The poppers were decent. They had cheddar cheese inside. A thicker coating but it still had some nice heat.   The pudding cake was great though! It was more of a pudding than cake. It had what I believe to be a grahmcracker crust then I believe it was a layer of cheesecake! But that's not it. On top of that there was a layer of chocolate pudding followed by a thick layer of whipped cream! It was lovely and decadent. All in all it was OK. We just popped everything in the microwave and it was alright. I've seen some reviews that say its just as good or better than salt lick. I wouldn't go that far. But I also wouldn't go to the other end and say its bill miller. Its solidly OK. Could you fire up your grill and make something as good or better? Definitely.

I gave Chief's BBQ a try. Overall, I wasn't impressed and can only recommend if you are craving sausage. I ordered a three meat plate with brisket, pork ribs, and smoked turkey. I added a bite of sausage so I could give it all a try. For sides, I had fried okra, pinto beans, and potato salad. The ribs were thinly cut and were served barely warm. The brisket and turkey had little flavor. There was no rub on the brisket and I found it lacking any character. The bright shining star is the sausage. It is from Elgin and tastes like heaven. Sadly, I have a feeling this has more to do with Elgin's fame than Chief's BBQ knowledge. I enjoyed the pinto beans--they were stellar. The potato salad and fried okra were mediocre at best. The ambiance is great. This is a nice little restaraunt and I felt comfortable. It was clean; but, the service was lacking. I felt I had interrupted the work day and the hand motions of the clerk taking a phone order made be believe they wanted the call to end quickly. In addition, the curse words yelled in the back and the TV tuned to snakes eating birds was quite off-putting. To sum up, the sausage and pinto beans are the only reasons to come to Chief's BBQ. They was so good and I highly recommend. However, the rest was just ""meh.""

I should have just gone to Bill Miller's.I like supporting local businesses, and this one is local. The one great thing it has going for it (aside from being near my house) is that the staff are so incredibly friendly. Unfortunately, the food doesn't match up. The brisket was borderline flavorless -- a theme that will come up again and again. The sauce that came with the brisket was watery and weak. I'm not sure where they found it, but it was bad enough that I threw it away and just grabbed some store-bought bottle stuff out of the fridge.I got some sausage to try it out... it wasn't bad. The menu calls it Elgin sausage, which may explain why it was the best of the group.I got some potato salad, onion rings and ""brew fries"" as my sides. The fries and onion rings were, again, flavorless. That's tough to do with an onion rings, but somehow they managed. They were thick onion rings with a uniform thick batter... but maybe it was just a plain flour breading... I don't know. The fries were non-descript.The potato salad was the best of the bunch, and even then was just ""good."" It's a mustard-based variety, which I personally like, and it hit the spots. Still, it had hints of generica mixed in.I know this isn't trying to be one of the top BBQ places in the country. It's just a strip-mall restaurant, so I have to cut them a break.

They probably have something similar to ""The Barney"" on their menu. But sometimes, if it's REALLY GOOD, ya just gotta ""fall off the food wagon"", ya know? A ""Barney a day"" WON'T keep the doctor away, but an occasional one will sure cure your Chicken-Fried Steak fix! To butcher on old saying: ""So good, and so NOT good for you."" But WICKED TASTY!! Then, you may need a good, loooong NAP.I can testify that all the sides are wonderful too (can I get a Witness?). CHEIF'S DELIVERS, if you live inside their delivery area. I don't know the boundaries of that area, I only know they'll deliver to ME; I live just N. of Wm. Cannon, just W.of Manchaca. Or you can pick up. They also have an inside dining room, and I think a coupla tables outside, but don't hold me to that. I usually order for pickup or delivery.The staff have always been friendly & accommodating to me. Prices are very reasonable. Depending on what you order, the sandwich / entrée itself will be under $10, or just a little over. So using the soon-to-be-famous ""Yelp-dollar-meter"", it would be a High ""$"", or a Low ""$$"" per person. I don't go out much for BBQ. Why? Because I have my OWN smoker, and after years of trial (and LOTS of error), I've perfected my 'Cue. So I only order or go out for BBQ when I don't have any laying around. It's not like whippin' out a burger; a good, tender brisket takes a MINIMUM of 16 hours of slow-smokin'. I typically smoke mine for a full 24 hours. So when ya get hungry around HERE, ya either have some ready, or ya just go to Chief's. I usually just BBQ for myself or a few close friends or Family, on my lil' New Braunfels brand smoker that will hold no more than two briskets at a time. But I've catered a COMPLETE BBQ dinner, sides & all, for OVER FIFTY PEOPLE, on a 20-foot commercial-size trailer / smoker, BY MYSELF. Point is, I KNOW MY BBQ, and have been told by some (not all) that my BBQ is the best they've ever had. The rest of 'em had no complaints. Guess they didn't wanna get slapped (hehe). I'm NOT tryin' to brag here, just to illustrate that I KNOW MY BBQ.And if I like Chief's BBQ, I'm confident that YOU will too. If you live in this part of town (""Far South Austin"") and have been ""Milling around Bill's"", so to speak, give Chief's a shot. You'll enjoy 'em, and you'll be back.FIVE STARS for me!larrythediner.","Austin, TX",198,7,0,"[4.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0]",Sep-13,11,5,0,['never']

When I go to a BBQ restaurant, I want food that tastes good without having to drown it in sauce. Otherwise, I might as well just have baked something in the oven and put sauce on it. Southside did not disappoint last night.Everything was seasoned well, nothing was dry, and extremely well portioned. I wish I had photos, but we were hungry. We split a stuff BBQ potato and a three meat plateBBQ/baked potato was huge with quite a bit of chopped brisket on it. They kindly put the sour cream on the side so it didn't get cool off the potato. It also tasted like an actual BBQ potato! I've been to too many restaurants in Austin were their ""BBQ"" potato probably looked at the pit for a few minutes for inspiration or something and they called it a ""BBQ potato.""The three meat plate had their ""pork steak"", mixed brisket and a chicken breast. Huge portions for the price and my sides were coleslaw and a side salad. The sides were pretty great for a BBQ restaurant, greens and tomatoes were fresh. If you expect great coleslaw, then you might be disappointed - but why are you going to a BBQ restaurant for vegetables? The pork steak was fantastic and was easily my favorite thing on the mixed plate. The chicken was great too, not dry like so many BBQ chicken places (excluding Inka Chicken and Pollo Rico, both have excellent chicken). Brisket was well seasoned and tender - solid brisket.As others have said, the moist brisket had a layer of fat, but I'm beginning to suspect that some demographic in this area prefers that. It didn't bother me too much, but then again I didn't get a huge amount of it. The chopped brisket on the baked potato we ordered didn't have any fatty parts on it, but wasn't dry either.Also, their blackberry cobbler was pretty great. A lot of actual blackberries, which was a welcome surprise, and since I had leftover white bread, I used that as a replacement for the crust. Heresy probably, but it tasted great so I don't mind. Overall, I highly recommend Southside for BBQ that actually tastes good. We placed the order online and picked up curbside which circumvented a lot of the crowd. Note that they only have pickup in the front of the store, so don't look around back for a curbside spot.","Pflugerville, TX",4,12,19,"[8.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0]",May-11,31,1,0,['never']

And the 2nd time we left with nothing because they were sold out. The first time was maybe a month and a half ago. We just chalked that up to it being new and not sure what to make. But tonight at 6:20 we visited again, after standing in line for 15 minutes with nobody taking orders and just walking around looking completely lost a manager came out and said that they were out of everything but sausage. They were out of almost all their sides and all their desserts. At this point there will not be a third try, this just reminds me why I prefer Meyers in Elgin so much better over the southside. It's quite possible that this could be the best tasting barbecue in the world but I will never know because of how poorly ran the management is and I will not waste anymore time going there to try to spend my money with you.","Hutto, TX",0,3,0,[],Apr-18,0,0,0,['never']

If you are someone who goes inside to eat, and there is a line in the drive-through, you will never ever get to leave. I don't know who designed this monstrosity, but they need to be put in jail. Second we were in the drive-through for 45 minutes. When we finally got there we were astounded at how expensive it was to get just a little bit to go for two people. We drove all the way  home to eat our dinner only to discover that we had paid $17 for a pound of chopped brisket but hand received than 1/3 of a pound. When I called them they really couldn't have cared less. I sent them a picture of it on my food scale. They wanted my number so the manager could call me back. All I wanted was my stinking dinner. I had to come up with a solution because the assistant manager had no clue what to do (ended up going back up there to the curbside pickup). After all that the chopped beef was extremely dry & tasteless, the macaroni and cheese had beans in it and the pinto beans had macaroni it them. This would never have worked for people who don't like their food mixed. So for a mediocre meal at best, for two people we spent $40,  had to make two trips, wait 45 minutes in the drive through, 10 minutes in the curbside and the food was not good at all. I'll stick with the local guys. Or Rudy's or my own pit. PS The gal at the window was super friendly and polite. She said thank you for your business.

The reason is due to the online pickup area being placed in such a poor location; it is right in front of the entrance as soon as you walk in.  When the line builds up here, customers who are entering to dine have to squeeze past customers standing in line to pick up their orders or vice versa. Secondly, the staff does not ask people standing in line if they are there to pick up an order or are they there to place one.  Why does this matter?  Well if you ordered and paid online, the typical customer would like the convenience of just walking in, providing their name, grabbing their food and departing.  Instead, you wait 15 to 20 minutes for the customer in front of you to complete their order, the whole time staring at your own order sitting on the counter.  My complaint today is  for a separate issue.  As I patiently waited in line for 15 minutes to pick up my order, I noticed a small pack of precooked pork ribs marked at a price of $4.98.  I grabbed the pack and when I finally got my turn at the counter, the staff member rang up my ribs but then said, ""Wait, this price is not right.""  He then commenced to weighing the package, then changed the price to $13.98 and asked me if I still wanted them.  I told him I wanted them at the price they were originally marked at and the customer behind me chimed in to agree with me, stating the obvious, ""That is bs and you cannot change the price. You have to honor the price the item originally had!""  The staff member gave some lame excuse about meat being placed out with wrong prices and he was ""just doing what he was told"".  Got it.  But no apology for the mix up, no customer service AT ALL, just ""do you want it or not"".  Or not.  And I won't be back either.  Not because of the $7 difference, but for the lack of customer service and best business practices.","Pflugerville, TX",0,1,0,[],Feb-20,0,0,0,['never']

My order was the roast duck and pork combo. To start it was delicious. The pork was well seasoned with that crispy skin that snaps. Awesome. Some may find duck a tad fatty. I was in heaven. Not healthy, but anything good in life is not healthy...lol. Lots of flavors. A gaming taste that worked. The skin was tasty. Very tasty combo.The staff was about to have their meal when I sat down. Take a look at their meal (picture below). It looked good. Real good. I was going to join them. My kind of meal. Rice. Veggie. Soup.

My friends and I were hoping to eat dim sum at a restaurant nearby but was told it would be a 45 minute wait so we came here to First Chinese instead. Big mistake. While we got seated right away, we waited OVER 45 minutes for our food. Clearly, we should've waited the 45 minutes for dim sum. A 45+ minute wait for food is absurd.While this was my first time at the Austin location, I have frequented the Richardson (a Dallas suburb) location multiple times. You can usually always count on First Chinese to whip up some solid Chinese cuisine. But the long wait for food after ordering was just a major turnoff. We ordered the beef flat noodle, crispy seafood noodle, salty fried squid and the roast pork & BBQ pork plate. The beef flat noodle wasn't as flavorful as I remembered. The beef itself was super tender and the noodles were all consistently soft. The crispy seafood noodle was solid and hefty. Good flavors and huge portion. The salty fried squid was also very delicious. I loved all the spicy jalapeño peppers that it came with. Consistent fry, good chewy texture to the squid, and overall great taste. What I don't understand is they have all this roast pork and BBQ pork out in the front in the BBQ area yet it was the last of our items to arrive. I figured the roast pork and BBQ pork plate would be easiest to prepare seeing as they always have those items ready to go - they just need to chop it up and put it on a plate. The roast pork was off the day we went. The crispy, crunchy skin is supposed to be the best part but it was on the chewy side. The pork meat itself lacked flavor and had a tougher texture. We usually get a mixture of dark meat and white meat but all our roast pork slices were white meat. The BBQ pork was so not the business either. Good flavor which is to be expected from First Chinese but the pork tasted overcooked. It wasn't as tender as it should have been.","Dallas, TX",424,541,219,"[183.0, 206.0, 113.0, 22.0, 17.0]",Dec-10,922,334,428,"['Elite 2019', '’18', '’17', '’16', '’15', '’14', '’13', '’12']"

That year and last year I ate their brisket chili often as it was very tasty and different than regular chili.I have always ordered it as ""Frito Pie"" with the chili laid on top of a bed of Frito corn chips and shredded cheese and onions on top of the chili.It might have been the time of day I was at the Round Rock location (about 7:00 PM on a Friday evening) but this year's first serving of the Frito  Pie wasn't as good as I remembered from their Parmer Ln store.The chili itself was not served as warm as it should have been, and the overall taste of the chili was that it had been sitting on the steam table for too long. It was a bit dry and lacked the flavor I was expecting. The presentation wasn't as nice either. As you can see from the photo I have posted, it was served in a bowl. At Parmer Lane last year and the year before, the served it on a large square dining plate. I was able to easily add some pico de gallo and extra onions. All fall I was waiting for January when Poke-E-Jo's had Frito Pie on the menu. It is now February 2 and I am concerned I am going to be disappointed the rest of the season.

You can also pre-order your meal so that you are guaranteed to get exactly what you want without the risk of them running out of a certain meat.  We decided to roll the dice and order when we arrived, and they unfortunately were out of chicken and turkey, which was our own fault for not pre-ordering (we were just not sure what we wanted or how much we wanted).  They had plenty of sides that we wanted, and they gave us all the bread we wanted including buns without charging us extra, which was much appreciated.  We brought our own cake, and they gladly provided us some small plates without a plating charge or giving us grief.  They have definitely improved upon their customer service since I provided a review last year.Note - to reserve the front room all to yourself, you have to put up $250 up front and then pay anything above that.  However, if you want to reserve some tables at the risk of not having the front room to yourself, then there is no booking charge.  In summary, I would definitely return with a large group and appreciate the hospitality shown to us and definitely recommend Pok-E-Jo's in Round Rock for large parties.","Austin, TX",24,14,13,"[3.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 11.0]",Nov-14,33,5,2,['never']

There is a wide variety of sides available beyond the standard beans, coleslaw, and potato salad offered at many BBQ joints. My personal favorites are the potato salad, green bean casserole, and fried okra. In my opinion, your best meat bets are the ribs and sausage, particularly the hatch chile sausage when available.

Main problem: small portions for the price. My whole family walked out hungry, and for the same amount we spend at Pok-e-jos, and there we all leaves full and happy. I was really craving a good pit smoked chared brisket. The Smokey mos brisket was ok if lackluster. Didn't hit the bbq spot. The turkey was ok, again, not great. The sausage sandwich was a letdown. Meh sausage on a plain hamburger bun. The sides: canned green beans and waterlogged corn on the cob. The one bright spot that I will praise was the bbq chicken.  That was delicious!  It was smoky and crusty and juicy.  I wish I'd ordered more of that! The location is convenient.  The store front is nice. The folks behind the counter were nice... but i was looking for good bbq worth coming back for, and unfortunately I didn't find it.","Austin, TX",1,62,4,"[17.0, 17.0, 7.0, 5.0, 16.0]",Aug-11,51,26,15,['never']
